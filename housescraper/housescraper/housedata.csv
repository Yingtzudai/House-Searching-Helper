The 39 m² master floor exudes a spa-like atmosphere with a freestanding bath and separate glass shower cubicle. 
 The spacious built-in storage space, the bed in the bay window with a view of the water and the TV on the ceiling with an automated swivel arm enhance the luxury of this floor.

WesterparkWest 
In WesterparkWest, you live with all the comforts and facilities of the city, in the greenery of an urban square with everything you need. A good cup of coffee on the terrace, running routes through the park, in the middle of urban life with all the space and comfort. 
The old office area serves as the raw material for a new, modern residential area. From closed to open. From grey and gloomy to green and relaxed. From workplace to a relaxed residential, working and living environment. 
 One prime location, seven residential buildings 
WesterparkWest offers a wide range of high-quality rental housing spread across seven unique residential buildings: Salt, Pepper, Blend and the four Basil buildings (North, East, South and West). Together, these buildings offer 552 flats, each with its own character and appeal. Whether you are young, old, single or living together, here you will find a home that suits you. The homes range from 1-, 2-, 3- and even 4-room flats and are designed with the modern resident in mind. 
A significant proportion of the flats in Basil (95 of the 250 homes) are available for middle-income earners, according to the guidelines of the Amsterdam municipality. These homes are subject to a maximum income limit of €75,362 (price level 2024). In addition, a number of free sector flats offer the option of being shared by two house-sharing tenants. 
 Sustainable and comfortable living 
All buildings in WesterparkWest combine comfort with sustainability. The flats are connected to a WKO system, which provides regulated heating in winter and cooling in summer. They have excellent ventilation and have at least energy label A, with some homes even achieving A++ or A+++. Solar panels on the roofs provide energy for general facilities, making the buildings contribute to a more sustainable future. NOTE: Tenants enter into a separate, separate agreement with Unica for the WKO system. The agreement, rates and conditions will be shared when the rental agreement is sent. 
 Unique living comfort 
Each flat offers fantastic views and a carefree living experience. Smart layouts, modern amenities and a peaceful living environment make WesterparkWest a place where everyone feels at home in the heart of Amsterdam. You can easily store your bicycle under the complex. If you have an electric bike, you can easily charge the loose battery in a locker. For car enthusiasts, a private parking space is additionally available for rent. The monthly rent is € 175 (plus € 15 service charge per month). 
 In the green 
Westerpark is literally at your feet. Westerpark West is built and designed as a very high-quality place to live, work and recreate. Picnicking with your friends, playing football with the children, running laps with your neighbours or quietly enjoying the view from your own terrace: it's all possible here. We try to make 'time' here into Quality Time in every way possible. We do this with good facilities for the entire neighbourhood (think catering establishments, day nurseries) and smart, comfortable buildings (use of sustainable installations and state-of-the-art technology). In addition, we examine whether and how we can provide a possible programme of shared and personal services, such as cleaning and concierge services.

Everything within walking distance and by bike you will experience a wide variety of city activities within 15 minutes.

You enter into a rent contract for one year. After that, the contract can be terminated monthly. 
There is a possibility to apply for rent allowance. Whether you are eligible for a rent allowance is of course entirely dependent on your income, you can calculate this on the website of the Dutch tax authorities. 
 AM I ELIGIBLE TO RENT AN APARTMENT? 
You are eligible to rent an apartment if you meet all these conditions: 
 
 
 I am a young professional 
 
 
 I am looking for a living environment with a community of like-minded people 
 
 
 I earn a gross salary of EUR 3.220 per month 
 
 
 I want to rent for at least one year 
 
 
 In this project, guaranteeing eligibility is not possible!

LOCATION 
The building is located in the Nieuw-West district, just outside the Amsterdam ring road. Supermarkets and nice cosy shops and restaurants are in the immediate vicinity. In addition, there is plenty of greenery within walking distance; on one side of the building the Sloterplas with surrounding park and on the other side the Rembrandtpark with its beautiful ponds, lawns and playgrounds and which also offers a 'green' cycling route to the city centre. The centre of Amsterdam is only 15 minutes away by bike from the apartment. At a short distance from the building are several bus, tram and metro stops via which you can be door-to-door at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport in half an hour, as well as Amsterdam Central Station. By car, you can reach the A10 motorway within minutes. 
 OUR SERVICES 
The Tenant Ambassadors from To Be At are at your service every day to provide you with an optimal living experience. Whether it's carrying out a repair request in your home, directing the cleaning when an accident has happened or just having a chat, they are happy to do so. You speak to them in the atrium, create a ticket in our own resident app or send a chat message - getting in touch has never been easier! 
With our services, we make your life easier and more fun! For example, we offer various services such as the Miele Laundry Boutique, a shared laundry facility, MyPup lockers, for receiving and sending packages in a safe and sustainable way, and you can book our cleaning service for cleaning your studio. 
Already interested in renting an apartment? Check if you are eligible and sign up to rent! 
 OUR COMMUNITY 
We're on a mission to reintroduce the element of community in urban apartment living. The ecosystem we create, helps you interact with your fellow residents while protecting your personal space. From cozy get-to-gethers to big events with your neighbors; we believe that life is infinitely more joyful when we're truly connected and never need to feel alone. 
The building has an atrium where you can work and enjoy a snack from the vending machines. Next to the atrium is the communal living room, which invites you to relax, watch a movie or play a game with your fellow residents. 
Both areas are designed to encourage interaction so you can connect with your neighbours. Both spaces are currently undergoing an 'upgrade'. They are being completely repainted and fitted with new furniture, so that these spaces can be even better used by the community and you too can really feel at home there. 
 WHAT WILL THE RENT OF AN APARTMENT COST ME? 
The basic rent is EUR 805 per month. 
In addition, you pay a service charge of EUR 176  per month. These costs are charged for the services offered, such as the caretakers (Tenant Ambassadors), cleaning, security, flooring, sunblind but also for internet and heating in your apartment. 
Service costs are an advance payment. Every year, you will receive an overview of the actual costs incurred. If applicable, the costs will be settled. 
You enter into a rent contract for one year. After that, the contract can be terminated monthly. 
There is a possibility to apply for rent allowance. Whether you are eligible for a rent allowance is of course entirely dependent on your income, you can calculate this on the website of the Dutch tax authorities. 
 AM I ELIGIBLE TO RENT AN APARTMENT? 
You are eligible to rent an apartment if you meet all these conditions: 
 
 
 I am a young professional 
 
 
 I am looking for a living environment with a community of like-minded people 
 
 
 I earn a gross salary of EUR 3.220 per month 
 
 
 I want to rent for at least one year

Welcome to Domus Houthaven 
Views of the city centre on one side and Amsterdam's harbours on the other. Domus Houthaven is located in the middle of the new sustainable city district, right next to the centre of Amsterdam. With 235 rental flats and various communal areas and services, everything here is geared towards modern city living. Properties are regularly available. 
 A smart home 
Domus Houthaven features a diversity of flats. Ranging from 40 sqm to 60 sqm. All homes come with solid PVC flooring, curtains and the 'smart living core' with kitchen, bathroom, cupboards, and bed. So ready to move into. 
 With many extras 
Living at Domus is living with many extra amenities. In the living room and roof garden, you walk in to work for a while or meet others. The other facilities work on a 'pay per use' basis. So no unnecessarily high service costs, but only pay for what you actually use. 
 Bringing soul into the building 
Shared spaces and facilities play a key role in Domus Living. Christa de Buvry de Mauregnault, owner of operator TO BE AT, makes sure everything is arranged and runs smoothly at the venue. 'The uniqueness of Domus lies in the combination of a smart, compact home with the possibility of extra living space in the shared living room, cooking studio and garden. This offers residents optimal living pleasure and convenience at the lowest possible ecological footprint. It is great to see that everyone uses those shared extra spaces exactly as they are intended. That goes very organically. As TO BE AT, we are there for the residents, to bring soul to this fantastic building. With hospitality, services and technology. Facility manager Marco is there every day to answer questions and pick up jobs. And community manager Rajeb himself lives in the building. He will help and inspire fellow residents to organise activities. Tenant satisfaction is already high: Domus scores a 9.3. We are proud of that and want to maintain it!'

WesterparkWest 
In WesterparkWest, you live with all the comforts and facilities of the city, in the greenery of an urban square with everything you need. A good cup of coffee on the terrace, running routes through the park, in the middle of urban life with all the space and comfort. 
The old office area serves as the raw material for a new, modern residential area. From closed to open. From grey and gloomy to green and relaxed. From workplace to a relaxed residential, working and living environment. 
 One prime location, seven residential buildings 
WesterparkWest offers a wide range of high-quality rental housing spread across seven unique residential buildings: Salt, Pepper, Blend and the four Basil buildings (North, East, South and West). Together, these buildings offer 552 flats, each with its own character and appeal. Whether you are young, old, single or living together, here you will find a home that suits you. The homes range from 1-, 2-, 3- and even 4-room flats and are designed with the modern resident in mind. 
A significant proportion of the flats in Basil (95 of the 250 homes) are available for middle-income earners, according to the guidelines of the Amsterdam municipality. These homes are subject to a maximum income limit of €75,362 (price level 2024). In addition, a number of free sector flats offer the option of being shared by two house-sharing tenants. 
 Sustainable and comfortable living 
All buildings in WesterparkWest combine comfort with sustainability. The flats are connected to a WKO system, which provides regulated heating in winter and cooling in summer. They have excellent ventilation and have at least energy label A, with some homes even achieving A++ or A+++. Solar panels on the roofs provide energy for general facilities, making the buildings contribute to a more sustainable future. NOTE: Tenants enter into a separate, separate agreement with Unica for the WKO system. The agreement, rates and conditions will be shared when the rental agreement is sent. 
 Unique living comfort 
Each flat offers fantastic views and a carefree living experience. Smart layouts, modern amenities and a peaceful living environment make WesterparkWest a place where everyone feels at home in the heart of Amsterdam. You can easily store your bicycle under the complex. If you have an electric bike, you can easily charge the loose battery in a locker. For car enthusiasts, a private parking space is additionally available for rent. The monthly rent is € 175 (plus € 15 service charge per month). 
 In the green 
Westerpark is literally at your feet. Westerpark West is built and designed as a very high-quality place to live, work and recreate. Picnicking with your friends, playing football with the children, running laps with your neighbours or quietly enjoying the view from your own terrace: it's all possible here.

In addition, we examine whether and how we can provide a possible programme of shared and personal services, such as cleaning and concierge services.

Already interested in renting an apartment? Check if you are eligible and sign up to rent! 
 OUR COMMUNITY 
We're on a mission to reintroduce the element of community in urban apartment living. The ecosystem we create, helps you interact with your fellow residents while protecting your personal space. From cozy get-to-gethers to big events with your neighbors; we believe that life is infinitely more joyful when we're truly connected and never need to feel alone. 
The building has an atrium where you can work and enjoy a snack from the vending machines. Next to the atrium is the communal living room, which invites you to relax, watch a movie or play a game with your fellow residents. 
Both areas are designed to encourage interaction so you can connect with your neighbours. Both spaces are currently undergoing an 'upgrade'. They are being completely repainted and fitted with new furniture, so that these spaces can be even better used by the community and you too can really feel at home there. 
 WHAT WILL THE RENT OF AN APARTMENT COST ME? 
The basic rent is EUR 805 per month. 
In addition, you pay a service charge of EUR 176  per month. These costs are charged for the services offered, such as the caretakers (Tenant Ambassadors), cleaning, security, flooring, sunblind but also for internet and heating in your apartment. 
Service costs are an advance payment. Every year, you will receive an overview of the actual costs incurred. If applicable, the costs will be settled. 
You enter into a rent contract for one year. After that, the contract can be terminated monthly. 
There is a possibility to apply for rent allowance. Whether you are eligible for a rent allowance is of course entirely dependent on your income, you can calculate this on the website of the Dutch tax authorities. 
 AM I ELIGIBLE TO RENT AN APARTMENT? 
You are eligible to rent an apartment if you meet all these conditions: 
 
 
 I am a young professional 
 
 
 I am looking for a living environment with a community of like-minded people

Welcome to Domus Houthaven 
Views of the city centre on one side and Amsterdam's harbours on the other. Domus Houthaven is located in the middle of the new sustainable city district, right next to the centre of Amsterdam. With 235 rental flats and various communal areas and services, everything here is geared towards modern city living. Properties are regularly available. 
 A smart home 
Domus Houthaven features a diversity of flats. Ranging from 40 sqm to 60 sqm. All homes come with solid PVC flooring, curtains and the 'smart living core' with kitchen, bathroom, cupboards, and bed. So ready to move into. 
 With many extras 
Living at Domus is living with many extra amenities. In the living room and roof garden, you walk in to work for a while or meet others. The other facilities work on a 'pay per use' basis. So no unnecessarily high service costs, but only pay for what you actually use. 
 Bringing soul into the building 
Shared spaces and facilities play a key role in Domus Living. Christa de Buvry de Mauregnault, owner of operator TO BE AT, makes sure everything is arranged and runs smoothly at the venue. 'The uniqueness of Domus lies in the combination of a smart, compact home with the possibility of extra living space in the shared living room, cooking studio and garden. This offers residents optimal living pleasure and convenience at the lowest possible ecological footprint. It is great to see that everyone uses those shared extra spaces exactly as they are intended. That goes very organically. As TO BE AT, we are there for the residents, to bring soul to this fantastic building. With hospitality, services and technology. Facility manager Marco is there every day to answer questions and pick up jobs. And community manager Rajeb himself lives in the building. He will help and inspire fellow residents to organise activities. Tenant satisfaction is already high: Domus scores a 9.3. We are proud of that and want to maintain it!'

WesterparkWest 
In WesterparkWest, you live with all the comforts and facilities of the city, in the greenery of an urban square with everything you need. A good cup of coffee on the terrace, running routes through the park, in the middle of urban life with all the space and comfort. 
The old office area serves as the raw material for a new, modern residential area. From closed to open. From grey and gloomy to green and relaxed. From workplace to a relaxed residential, working and living environment. 
 One prime location, seven residential buildings 
WesterparkWest offers a wide range of high-quality rental housing spread across seven unique residential buildings: Salt, Pepper, Blend and the four Basil buildings (North, East, South and West). Together, these buildings offer 552 flats, each with its own character and appeal. Whether you are young, old, single or living together, here you will find a home that suits you. The homes range from 1-, 2-, 3- and even 4-room flats and are designed with the modern resident in mind. 
A significant proportion of the flats in Basil (95 of the 250 homes) are available for middle-income earners, according to the guidelines of the Amsterdam municipality. These homes are subject to a maximum income limit of €75,362 (price level 2024). In addition, a number of free sector flats offer the option of being shared by two house-sharing tenants. 
 Sustainable and comfortable living 
All buildings in WesterparkWest combine comfort with sustainability. The flats are connected to a WKO system, which provides regulated heating in winter and cooling in summer. They have excellent ventilation and have at least energy label A, with some homes even achieving A++ or A+++. Solar panels on the roofs provide energy for general facilities, making the buildings contribute to a more sustainable future. NOTE: Tenants enter into a separate, separate agreement with Unica for the WKO system. The agreement, rates and conditions will be shared when the rental agreement is sent. 
 Unique living comfort 
Each flat offers fantastic views and a carefree living experience. Smart layouts, modern amenities and a peaceful living environment make WesterparkWest a place where everyone feels at home in the heart of Amsterdam. You can easily store your bicycle under the complex. If you have an electric bike, you can easily charge the loose battery in a locker. For car enthusiasts, a private parking space is additionally available for rent. The monthly rent is € 175 (plus € 15 service charge per month). 
 In the green 
Westerpark is literally at your feet. Westerpark West is built and designed as a very high-quality place to live, work and recreate. Picnicking with your friends, playing football with the children, running laps with your neighbours or quietly enjoying the view from your own terrace: it's all possible here. We try to make 'time' here into Quality Time in every way possible. We do this with good facilities for the entire neighbourhood (think catering establishments, day nurseries) and smart, comfortable buildings (use of sustainable installations and state-of-the-art technology). In addition, we examine whether and how we can provide a possible programme of shared and personal services, such as cleaning and concierge services.

At 801 Elizabeth Cady Stantonplein, you will find this beautiful Young Professional building, completed in 2019. The building is 10 floors high and has around 500 studios specially designed for working young people aged between 18 and 36. The building is sustainable, green and natural gas-free. In this way, the landlord contributes to a green planet. 
 The location 
Amsterdam-Zuidoost is close to various parks such as the Nelson Mandela Park (a 5-minute walk). There is also a nice shopping centre at 1-minute walking distance: Amsterdamse Poort. Amsterdam-Zuidoost is easily accessible by public transport. Both train station and metro station Amsterdam Bijlmer Arena are only a 10-minute walk away. There are also many bus connections, making it easy to reach small nearby towns as well. 
 Our service 
You enter the building with a badge system. At the entrance, you can choose to take the lift to your studio or take the stairs to the atrium. In the spacious atrium, you can meet other residents or find a quiet place to work. Next to the atrium is the communal living room, here too you can meet fellow residents or find some relaxation!

WesterparkWest 
In WesterparkWest, you live with all the comforts and facilities of the city, in the greenery of an urban square with everything you need. A good cup of coffee on the terrace, running routes through the park, in the middle of urban life with all the space and comfort. 
The old office area serves as the raw material for a new, modern residential area. From closed to open. From grey and gloomy to green and relaxed. From workplace to a relaxed residential, working and living environment. 
 One prime location, seven residential buildings 
WesterparkWest offers a wide range of high-quality rental housing spread across seven unique residential buildings: Salt, Pepper, Blend and the four Basil buildings (North, East, South and West). Together, these buildings offer 552 flats, each with its own character and appeal. Whether you are young, old, single or living together, here you will find a home that suits you. The homes range from 1-, 2-, 3- and even 4-room flats and are designed with the modern resident in mind. 
A significant proportion of the flats in Basil (95 of the 250 homes) are available for middle-income earners, according to the guidelines of the Amsterdam municipality. These homes are subject to a maximum income limit of €75,362 (price level 2024). In addition, a number of free sector flats offer the option of being shared by two house-sharing tenants. 
 Sustainable and comfortable living 
All buildings in WesterparkWest combine comfort with sustainability. The flats are connected to a WKO system, which provides regulated heating in winter and cooling in summer. They have excellent ventilation and have at least energy label A, with some homes even achieving A++ or A+++. Solar panels on the roofs provide energy for general facilities, making the buildings contribute to a more sustainable future. NOTE: Tenants enter into a separate, separate agreement with Unica for the WKO system. The agreement, rates and conditions will be shared when the rental agreement is sent. 
 Unique living comfort 
Each flat offers fantastic views and a carefree living experience. Smart layouts, modern amenities and a peaceful living environment make WesterparkWest a place where everyone feels at home in the heart of Amsterdam. You can easily store your bicycle under the complex. If you have an electric bike, you can easily charge the loose battery in a locker. For car enthusiasts, a private parking space is additionally available for rent. The monthly rent is € 175 (plus € 15 service charge per month). 
 In the green 
Westerpark is literally at your feet. Westerpark West is built and designed as a very high-quality place to live, work and recreate. Picnicking with your friends, playing football with the children, running laps with your neighbours or quietly enjoying the view from your own terrace: it's all possible here. We try to make 'time' here into Quality Time in every way possible. We do this with good facilities for the entire neighbourhood (think catering establishments, day nurseries) and smart, comfortable buildings (use of sustainable installations and state-of-the-art technology). In addition, we examine whether and how we can provide a possible programme of shared and personal services, such as cleaning and concierge services. 
 Location 
Everything within walking distance and by bike you will experience a wide variety of city activities within 15 minutes. Fine dining, cinema, theatre, strolling, concerts Amsterdam offers so much and from WesterParkWest everything is within easy reach.

 The rent does not include the advance payment of gas, water and electricity for the studio, for this you can make your own contract with an energy supplier. TV, internet and municipal taxes are paid by the tenant. The service charges for the common areas count 50 euros per month. The deposit is equal to one month's rent. The deposit will be returned when the accommodation is handed back to the landlord in at least the same condition. 
 RENTAL RATE 
 The property meets the conditions for applying for rent allowance. There are private facilities such as bathroom, toilet, cooking facilities behind a closed door and a bare rent below the rent allowance limit for applicants aged 23 and older. 
 Check on the site of the Inland Revenue whether you meet the conditions for applying for rent allowance yourself. This depends on your age, income and assets. 
 CANDIDATE 
 For this property we are looking for a student candidate. Only students enrolled at an educational institution are eligible for this housing, as it is rented under a so-called campus contract. Guarantor status is a plus.

                                                         ARCHITECTURALLY DESIGNED AND FURNISHED APARTMENT AVAILABLE ON KORTE NOODGODSSTRAAT IN GOUDA 
 On Korte Noodgodsstraat in Gouda, you will find this spacious apartment of 131 m², featuring two bedrooms and an indoor outdoor space. However, it’s not the size of this city-center apartment that makes it special, nor the fact that this maisonette includes an indoor outdoor space. No, it’s the unique design of the apartment that we would like to highlight. Words cannot do justice to the quality and appeal of this home, so we warmly invite you to take a look at the photos in this advertisement. 
 Still curious about how we describe this property? Read on: 
 Through the central entrance with an intercom system and mailboxes, you enter the former post office on Korte Noodgodsstraat, located in the heart of Gouda’s city center. The front door of this property is situated on the first floor of the complex, where you will find a spacious hallway with a cloakroom, toilet, and utility meter cupboard. 
 From the hallway, you enter the spacious and open living room, from which all living areas of the home are visible. The space is equipped with large windows spanning the entire facade, allowing for ample natural light. The use of glass walls allows light to flow freely throughout the home. 
 The living room, featuring a stylish poured floor, is spacious enough to comfortably accommodate both a seating area and a dining area. The kitchen has an open design and an industrial look, thanks to the extensive use of stainless steel. It is equipped with a 90 cm-wide induction hob with a large oven, an extractor hood, a dishwasher, a luxury mixer tap, and plenty of cabinet space. 
 On the second floor, accessible via the characteristic spiral staircase in the center of the living room, you will find two spacious bedrooms, a large landing ideal for creating a workspace, and the bathroom. A nice detail is that from your shower, you have a beautiful view of the rest of the home, while still enjoying the privacy you need in a bathroom. The bathroom is completed with a double sink, a separate toilet, and a utility area with connections for a washing machine and dryer. 
 An important feature to highlight is the indoor outdoor space in the living room. In the photos, you’ll recognize this area by the lounge set. This space is fully insulated from your home, and if desired, the windows can be left open 24/7. With a favorable sun orientation, it’s even possible to place outdoor plants here and see them bloom beautifully. Thanks to its sheltered location, you can enjoy this outdoor space early in the spring and late into the autumn. The apartment’s windows face the southwest side of the building and are equipped with external sunshades. 
 SPECIAL FEATURES 
 
 This property is offered for an indefinite period with a minimum rental term of 12 months. 
 You pay a utility advance of €275 per month for gas, water, and electricity, with an annual settlement. 
 This property includes a storage space on the ground floor of the complex. 
 Parking in the city center is only possible with a permit, which must be requested from the relevant authorities. 
 Current residents are offering some wardrobes for takeover.

 Description 
The City Hall Bridge Apartments are located in the very heart of Utrecht’s city centre in a magnificent and completely renovated building, which is a National Monument. The apartments can be found on the first and second floor of the building, that can be entered by a hallway on the ground floor. The apartments include everything you need to make your stay in Utrecht a wonderful experience. The apartment has got a warm and contemporary interior, a new kitchen and large bedroom with a large double bed. Furthermore the brand new bathroom offers all  the comfort needed with a shower, toilet, washbasin and a state of the art washing/dryer combination. 
 Location 
The street in which this apartment is located, is parallel with the Oudegracht and is located between the City Hall Bridge and the Zadelstraat. The fact that it is located on the end of the Choorstraat, on the City Hall Bridge, means that it includes a magnificent view over one of the most famous areas in the city that goes back a long way. Even during the Roman Empire this location used to be an area in which a vicus, basically a neighbourhood, within the Roman fortress Trajectum was located. The current street name goes back to the 16th century. The street was named after the location of the choir in the Buurkerk, a church that had to make place for traffic back in the days, the reason the street was made. Nowadays traffic is limited to pedestrians, and a lovely view over the historical sites of Utrecht is what it offers.

Wilgenrijk consists of various cozy and small-scale neighborhoods, each with its own architectural characteristics, and is shielded from ambient noise by a recreational park wall. The area is also very child friendly due to the natural playgrounds, among other things.    
 Within walking distance of your house in Wilgenrijk is a unique green area, embellished by mills, canals and monumental farms with beautiful walking and cycling routes.

 Ermelo and surroundings. 
 Ermelo is a popular place to live and no wonder. Here you will find not only the pleasant atmosphere of a village, but also many contemporary amenities. The cosy centre houses a wide choice of shops, from the well-known big chains to surprising speciality shops. There are nice cafés, terraces and restaurants, and there is a market every Tuesday morning. Ermelo is not lacking in other amenities either. 
For instance, there are plenty of sports and other associations and several primary and secondary schools. The uniqueness of Ermelo is that it has its feet on the water, ‘Het Wolderwijd’, and its back against the vast Veluwe forests. Therefore, there are plenty of water sports opportunities and you can enjoy mountain biking or hiking in the forests.  
 Southeast of Ermelo is the Ermelosche Heide, a 343-hectare area, largely in use as a nature reserve and available for daytime recreation. The site is criss-crossed by cycling, hiking and bridle paths. The heathland is grazed by its own sheep herd. The presence of a train station and its location near the A-28 motorway make Ermelo easily accessible from all directions.

 LAYOUT 
Upon entering, you are greeted by a beautiful stone floor that immediately captures attention and adorns both the ground floor and the first floor. To your left, you'll find the luxurious toilet, a preview of the upscale sanitary facilities that characterize the rest of the house. On the ground floor, there is the technical room with a heat pump and connections for the washer and dryer. Additionally, there is a convenient indoor storage room with a utility area.   
 First floor 
Upon entering the space, you immediately feel its grandeur. The spacious living room exudes the same refined stone floor, a built-in TV cabinet, and sideboard emphasizing high-quality finishes. Luxury wall lamps and subtle ceiling tracks add a touch of class, while the curtains seamlessly integrate with the window frames, creating a harmonious look. The steel doors are the crowning touch. 
The delightful kitchen is a beautiful example of design and functionality, where wooden materials perfectly blend with the surroundings of the home. Featuring a 5-burner induction hob, a cleverly integrated extractor hood, a Quooker, a refrigerator, freezer, dishwasher, microwave, and oven, this kitchen provides everything you need and more.

 Second floor 
On this floor, three beautiful bedrooms and the first luxurious bathroom are located. The spacious bathroom with beautiful marble features a double sink unit, an LED mirror cabinet, and a walk-in shower. The toilet, in the same style, is conveniently located separately.   
 Third floor 
The highlight awaits on the top floor: the majestic master bedroom. A private world of tranquility and privacy, with its own bathroom promising luxury with a double sink unit, an LED mirror cabinet, and a walk-in shower. Here, you wake up to a breathtaking view of the dunes and the water, and you can then enjoy a cup of coffee on your own terrace. There is also the option to transform this very spacious bedroom into two (sleeping) rooms. The presence of two built-in wardrobes on this floor adds the perfect finishing touch. 
 The home automation system allows you to set the mood lighting according to your preferences and turn all lights on or off with a simple press of a button. Thanks to the acoustic material on the ceiling, there is no echo in the space. The property is equipped with sun protection in the form of screens on the south and east sides. Finally, the property has 2 parking spaces, with the possibility to easily charge your electric car at home.

 The studio is located in a stately mansion. The mansion is completely newly built and equipped with all modern requirements. The building is fully insulated and equipped with a heat pump and solar panels, the building is also gas-free and has energy label A+! 
 The mansion combines charm and contemporary comfort into a harmonious whole. In short; this mansion is truly a picture! A total of 6 apartments/studios have been realised in this stately building. 
 A PIECE OF HISTORY 
On Kleine Marktstraat, there was a building dating back to 1840. Unfortunately, at the time of the conversion and renovation in 2021/2022, the building caught fire and was completely destroyed. We did not give up and decided to rebuild the premises. 
During the demolition of the old building, ancient remains from the 14th century were found! These can be found in the bedroom of 1 flat. Anno 2024, the new apartments/studio's have been completed. 
 LAYOUT 
Via the entrance, you enter the communal hallway and stairwell. On the 1st floor you will find the communal washing machines and dryers. 
 Open the door and you step into your studio. In total, this flat is about 36 m2 in size, with large windows, a PVC floor, new kitchen, new bathroom and fitted with underfloor heating. 
 The black kitchen with luxury countertop is elegant and modern, and above all, hyperefficiently designed. There is a dishwasher, an induction hob, an extractor hood, a combi oven/microwave and a sink. The kitchen was installed very recently! 
 Next is the small and beautiful bathroom; it too has been recently installed and is therefore also completely new. The bathroom comprises a WC with a hanging toilet, a design radiator, a washbasin and a (rain) shower. 
 ENVIRONMENT 
The right side of the property (on the outside) you walk towards the Vischmarkt, which is known for its many restaurants. Both the city centre with all its amenities and the cosy boulevard 
and the city beach are within walking distance. 
 HARDERWIJK IN A NUTSHELL 
This beautiful, monumental town has much more to offer than just a pretty face; it is a modern city in an ideal location in the country. Tranquillity and nature are just around the corner, as Harderwijk is situated on the edge of the leafy Veluwe, and on hot days the beaches along the lakes are really perfect for bathing - we speak from experience. 
The flat is also - behind the facade of classic beauty - a wonderfully comfortable and contemporary flat.

BUT FOR 
RENT. 
 Located directly on the Vecht in picturesque Maarssen, this monumental sleeping beauty has been completely transformed into a sustainable, luxurious and above all charming residential villa. A villa of no less than 178m2 which feels like a loft, by varying heights in ceilings and an open connection of several rooms with each other.

And this with stunning views of the Vecht, where every season shows its charm. 
This awake kissed beauty is available for rent immediately.  
 The chapel was originally built in 1901 as a hall church for churchgoers of the Dutch Protestants. In 1965, a local architect remodeled the church. This remodel created the glass windowed alcoves, a vestibule and a floor to ceiling.  
 Without compromising the original contours, a sustainable home was created with attention to detail. We are happy to explain the layout, the adjustments made to make the home more sustainable, what Maarssen has to offer as a location and the conditions for renting this home.

 Rental price 
 The rental price is excluding gas/water/electricity, but including service costs. 
 Deposit 
 At the start of the rental agreement, a deposit is required. 
 The apartment will be rented through 'Overbruggingsverhuur'. Overbruggingsverhuur provides a temporary rental agreement for properties that are for sale, based on the legal requirements of the 'Leegstandwet'. There is no waiting list and we offer well-kept houses for an affordable rent. 
 Rental period 
 The minimum rental period is 6 months up to a maximum for the duration of the permit according to the 'Leegstandwet'. 
 General information 
 In order to rent an Overbruggingsverhuur rental house, the tenant has to meet certain conditions. A summary of these conditions is outlined below. 
 Conditions regarding house hold income 
 To meet the income requirement, your net income will need to be approx. 3 times the rental price. Any other payment commitments (for example debt collection agency) will be deducted from the house hold income. Another possibility to meet this requirement is to pay a higher deposit.

 House review from previous tenants: 
 As we move on to the next chapter of our lives, we couldn’t leave without expressing our heartfelt gratitude for the wonderful years we spent in your home. For over three years, your house wasn’t just a rental—it became our safe haven, filled with warmth, laughter, and countless memories we will carry with us forever. 
 From the cozy evenings by the window to the tranquil mornings in the garden, every corner of your home brought us comfort and joy. Living in such a thoughtfully cared-for space made us feel truly lucky, and your kindness as landlords was the cherry on top. 
 Your home isn’t just a place to live—it’s a space where people can feel at home, and we have no doubt that the next tenants will feel just as fortunate as we did. 
 We can’t thank you enough.

 Experience in the area, we have listed it for you: 
 Amusement parks 
The most famous park in Biddinghuizen is Walibi World with the associated event area, where Lowlands, De Opwekking, etc. take place annually. Aviodrome, the park with the entire history of aviation, is only 7 km away. 
If you enjoy shopping, then a visit to Batavia Stad should not be missed. Even the Dolphinarium can be reached within half an hour. 
 Nature 
You can definitely go to Flevoland for a brisk walk or bicycle route. Lelystad Nature Park has beautiful walking / cycling paths and with a bit of luck you can see many animal species. Here it is also possible to rent bicycles. Of course you can also visit the Oostvaardersplassen. The beautiful nature film about this area “De Nieuwe Wildernis” has received a lot of publicity. If you would like to learn more about the Randmeren, a visit to the Veluwerandmeren Information Center should not be missed. If you want to enjoy beautiful blooming flowers, visit the Orchid Farm. If you prefer to go out with a solex, please contact Plus Events. 
 Active 
If you want even more action, take a look at 800 meters away at Dorhout Mees where there are many possibilities from clay pigeon shooting to off-road driving. Or view Flevoland from the water with the cruises on the Veluwemeer. 
 But there are also plenty of courses in the area for golf enthusiasts. For the recreational atmosphere there is Swingolf at the Meeuwenhoeve. People without Golf Certificate (GVB) can go to Shortgolf in Swifterbant or GolfbaanHarderwold in Zeewolde. The real golfer can indulge in the courses of Dorhout Mees, Golf Event Center in Lelystad or Golf Club Zeewolde. 
 Museums

                                                         Nowadays we increasingly offer a completely renovated home, in this specific case a complete floor has even been added and a real maisonette with three bedrooms has been created from an apartment. Completely in line with the latest trends and yet taking into account optimal usability, the landlord of this home has carried out his plan. It is a very bright home because the corner location has many windows. The home is located in a child-friendly neighborhood north of Haarlem Center.  
 This is a beautiful and central location 5 minutes by bike and 15 minutes on foot from the historic center of Haarlem and Central Station. You have all the facilities that Haarlem has to offer within a few minutes walking/cycling distance. Ideal location with regard to various schools, shops and close to highways to Amsterdam, Schiphol, Hoofddorp, etc. The ideal thing about this location is that there is plenty of parking available without the need for a permit. 
 Ground floor: Entrance in hallway which is equipped with authentic vestibule (ideal in winter to avoid the first cold when opening the front door) and wainscoting. Behind the stairs to the first floor you will find a storage cupboard where the washing machine can also be placed. 
 First floor: Central landing which gives access to the modern spacious toilet and the bizarrely light living room, which has a cool appearance due to the contrast of the white walls with the dark window frames, the very sensitive wooden 'herringbone' laid oak floorboards have now been replaced by much better maintained PVC floorboards, modern kitchen with the obvious built-in appliances. Through French doors you enter the south-facing roof terrace (the floor panels and the fencing around the terrace are not yet visible in the photos, but these have now been installed). 
 Second floor: Again a central landing which gives access to a (second) separate modern toilet, three bedrooms and the modern bathroom with bath, separate shower and beautiful washbasin.

                                                         When you think of Amsterdam, you think of the world-famous canal belt. When many centuries ago the canal belt was built as a prestigious new residential area for the wealthy Amsterdammers, it was already a unique and very exclusive plan. The houses are often built as true city palaces, and over the years these monumental buildings have been extensively rebuilt, renovated and divided into apartments. The canal belt offers a nice mix of nationalities and is therefore a very desirable neighborhood to live in. In terms of shops, restaurants as well as parks and public transport: everything is within walking distance. Likewise here. With the Utrechtsestraat on the corner with its many shops and restaurants, the Rembrandtplein, the many museums at the Museumplein, the Hermitage, the theaters and cinema around the Leidseplein: almost everything is in close proximity. 
 LAYOUT: 
The elevator is reached via a stately entrance with beautiful ornaments. The elevator goes to the second floor. Very spacious living room with beautiful ornaments and a view of the canal. Beautiful fireplace, fully equipped and modern kitchen with all imaginable options. Two spacious bedrooms, both with a luxurious bathroom and air conditioning. 
On the ground floor there is a great relaxation area, equipped with a spacious swimming pool with jet function, sauna and whirlpool. There is also a (shared) garden here, which can be used by the residents in consultation. All in all an oasis of peace in the middle of the bustling city center of Amsterdam.

 And then perhaps the most beautiful floor, in any case the cosiest: The extra floor is a completely renovated attic room, the original roof trusses divide this room into two parts, which makes it possible to create a very cozy bedroom/living room, of course this entire attic can also be used as storage space, but that would almost be a shame.

 Detached House with Spacious Garden and Privacy 
 A detached house of approximately 190 m² with an attached practice/office space, a large garden, and plenty of privacy. Located on a traffic-calmed square, surrounded by expansive green areas. 
 Behind the charming boundary fence, there is a spacious patio-style sun terrace with parking space for one car. The well-maintained “green” garden, developed over the years, immediately catches your eye.

The living room features large windows on three sides, providing an excellent view of the garden—especially enjoyable during the summer with the sliding doors open. The semi-open kitchen ensures a pleasant connection with the living area while still concealing the cooking area. 
 Location and Surroundings 
The house is situated in the ""villa section"" of Huntum, an area in the southern part characterized by detached and semi-detached architectural homes. Adjacent to the property is the vast Bijlmerpark. The surrounding area predominantly features low-rise buildings. 
 The location is extremely peaceful, due to both the lack of through traffic in the neighborhood and the secluded position of the house itself. The area has undergone significant transformation, with widespread demolition, new construction, renovation, and diversification, marking a remarkable urban renewal effort in Amsterdam Zuidoost.

 Complex and Surroundings 
This modern apartment complex (opened in the summer of 2020) sits at the crossroad of the monumental city streets Mathenesserlaan and Heemraadssingel, the latter one being known for its famous canal and green walking area.  The building itself has been entirely transformed, from a school building into a residential complex, of which only the structural beams and columns of the old building remained partly visible from the inside.   
 The surrounding neighbourhood has undergone major developments, while most of the houses and buildings in the area were built at the beginning of the previous century, more and more hip and alternative spots have opened lately. The apartment complex is perfectly located in the western part of the city centre, while it remained a quiet location it is still in the immediate vicinity of active and pleasant street life. There are various trendy shops, cafes and restaurants in the surrounding streets, like the Nieuwe Binnenweg, 2e Middellandstraat and Vierambachtsstraat. Besides, both parks and cultural facilities – including museums, theatres, cinemas and the well-known Blijdorp zoo – are all within easy reach.   
 Rotterdam Central Station can easily be reached by foot or bicycle, there are various public transport options (Bus, Tram, Metro, Train), and the ring road is also quickly and easily accessible by car. 
 Lay out 
Modern, lightful central hall to entry the building complex with access to the mailboxes and elevators. The central hall contains a ‘bring-me-box’ locker system where your parcels can be brought and safeguarded when you are not at home.   
 The entrance of the apartment is located on the ground floor, directly accessible from the central hall. The large windows in the bright living room ensure a pleasant view over the beautiful Heemraadssingel, where people quietly relax on the grass and enjoy the water in the summer, while children ice skate on the frozen Singel in the winter. The apartment is situated 1.5 meters above street level, the customised blinders prevents outsiders from looking inside while residents can still enjoy the astonishing view outside.    
 The living room contains modern furniture (including a Samsung The Frame TV, Philips Hue lighting), lovey couch with ottoman, cosy dining area, and open kitchen. The kitchen has a modern design with a granite worktop, spacious drawers & storage compartments and high-end AEG branded, energy efficient equipment (including a combi-oven, fridge, freezer, induction hob, extractor, dishwasher, integrated wine climate cabinet and electric kettle). The balcony of 6m2 (facing South-West) is accessible from the living room.  
 The spacious bedroom has a large double bed (box spring), a built-in wardrobe and a clothing rack. From here, there is direct access to the bathroom which has a double sink with heated mirror, bathroom furniture’s and a walk-in shower.   
 All furniture in the apartment is only 4 years old, and is still in perfect condition. The monthly cleaner keeps the apartment perfectly clean and pleasant.   
 From the hallway you can reach the separate toilet, as well as the cleaning/installation room where a washing machine (also AEG), domestic installations and storage space (several hanging shelves) are located. All rooms in the apartment have underfloor heating, and the air is purified via a mechanical ventilation system. Also, the apartment has an electronic security system.

 About the project 
Welcome to Domus Houthaven 
Views of the city centre on one side and Amsterdam's harbours on the other. Domus Houthaven is located in the middle of the new sustainable city district, right next to the centre of Amsterdam. With 235 rental flats and various communal areas and services, everything here is geared towards modern city living. Properties are regularly available. 
 A smart home 
Domus Houthaven features a diversity of flats. Ranging from 40 sqm to 60 sqm. All homes come with solid PVC flooring, curtains and the 'smart living core' with kitchen, bathroom, cupboards, and bed. So ready to move into. 
 With many extras 
Living at Domus is living with many extra amenities. In the living room and roof garden, you walk in to work for a while or meet others. The other facilities work on a 'pay per use' basis. So no unnecessarily high service costs, but only pay for what you actually use. 
 Bringing soul into the building 
Shared spaces and facilities play a key role in Domus Living. Christa de Buvry de Mauregnault, owner of operator TO BE AT, makes sure everything is arranged and runs smoothly at the venue. 'The uniqueness of Domus lies in the combination of a smart, compact home with the possibility of extra living space in the shared living room, cooking studio and garden. This offers residents optimal living pleasure and convenience at the lowest possible ecological footprint. It is great to see that everyone uses those shared extra spaces exactly as they are intended. That goes very organically. As TO BE AT, we are there for the residents, to bring soul to this fantastic building. With hospitality, services and technology. Facility manager Marco is there every day to answer questions and pick up jobs. And community manager Rajeb himself lives in the building. He will help and inspire fellow residents to organise activities. Tenant satisfaction is already high: Domus scores a 9.3. We are proud of that and want to maintain it!'

Tomorrow's housing solutions go beyond buildings. As a service brand, we are constantly improving the daily lives of residents and our environment.

This tasteful and pleasantly designed apartment with spacious roof terrace has approximately 125 m2 of living space and is located on the fourth and fifth floor (US counting) of a Monumental building (built in 1906) with stately entrance. 
 LAY-OUT 
 The entrance to the building is formed by a stately and well-maintained entrance equipped with an intercom system with camera. By means of the shared stairwell, you reach the entrance of the home, which is located on the second floor. 
 By means of the in-house staircase, you reach the fourth floor (US counting). Here you will find the bright and spacious living room (approximately 60 m2) with windows along the entire length of both sides, and the adjoining luxury kitchen and roof terrace. From the living room (4 windows wide), you have a unique, breath-taking view of the Singel and Blauwburgwal. 
 The custom kitchen (solid wood) is equipped with a beautiful marble countertop and various built-in appliances, such as a dishwasher, oven/microwave, 5-burner hob with designer stainless steel hood, refrigerator/freezer and a Quooker. 
 Through the French doors at the back of the apartment (location: southeast), you have access to a beautiful, spacious roof terrace measuring approximately 22 m2. 
Using the in-house staircase, you reach the bedroom floor with imposing beam construction, with ceilings that reach heights of up to approximately 4 metres. Here, you will find three full and ample-sized bedrooms, a luxurious bathroom and a separate laundry room. 
 The master bedroom has a surface area of approximately 14 m2 and feels very spacious thanks to the high ceilings. The luxury bathroom is equipped with a washbasin (double sinks), toilet, walk-in shower with rainshower, bath and towel radiator. 
The third bedroom is being used as a walk-in closet. 
 Across the upper floor, the wooden trusses and beams have been beautifully exposed. The solid wood floor panels are taken from a former ship from the VOC era. 
 During the full renovation (2017), only high-quality materials were used, which has created a very high level of finishing quality (e.g. panel doors, herringbone floor and ornaments). Naturally, numerous original features were retained that contribute to the Monumental feeling of living in the Amsterdam canal district.
