,LOCATION,
Scheveningen is a lively neighbourhood with dunes, beaches and the sea within walking distance. You can enjoy these every day if you live in Scheveningen. Go for a walk on the beach at sunset, hit the waves for a solid surfing session, or relax on a towel with a good book. If you’re looking for something a little different from the dunes, the beach and the sea, Scheveningen also borders an area with a number of beautiful parks, including the Scheveningse Bosjes, Westbroekpark and Hubertuspark. The district consists of the Dorp (Village), Haven (Harbor) and Bad (Bath) areas, each with its own character.,
With its characteristic Oude Kerk and Keizerstraat, the ‘Dorp’ is the meeting point for many residents. Densely clustered courts with narrow streets give some areas an authentic fishing village atmosphere. Keizerstraat is the oldest and most historic shopping street in Scheveningen. There are many small shops and restaurants, but also a large supermarket.,
Scheveningen ‘Haven’ has three different characters. The first inner harbor is the fishing port where fresh fish comes in daily and the rugged character is visible. There are nice cafés and restaurants around the second harbor, and sailing boats are moored there. There are also new apartment buildings with beautiful views. In the future there will be different kinds of dwellings appearing around the third harbor in a unique new development area.,
‘Bad’ boasts the historic Kurhaus, a cinema and the Circus Theater. These, together with the beautiful revamped promenade and the many beach pavilions, make this the tourism centre of Scheveningen. However, the residents of the district often also seek out the friendly hustle and bustle for a night out or just a stroll. (******),

,SURROUNDINGS,
Scheveningen is a lively neighbourhood with dunes, beaches and the sea within walking distance. You can enjoy these every day if you live in Scheveningen. Go for a walk on the beach at sunset, hit the waves for a solid surfing session, or relax on a towel with a good book. If you’re looking for something a little different from the dunes, the beach and the sea, Scheveningen also borders an area with a number of beautiful parks, including the Scheveningse Bosjes, Westbroekpark and Hubertuspark. The district consists of the Dorp (Village), Haven (Harbour) and Bad (Bath) areas, each with its own character.,
With its characteristic Oude Kerk and Keijzerstraat, the ‘Dorp’ is the meeting point for many residents. Densely clustered courts with narrow streets give some areas an authentic fishing village atmosphere. Keizerstraat is the oldest and most historic shopping street in Scheveningen. There are many small shops and eateries, but also a large supermarket.,
Scheveningen ‘Haven’ has three different characters. The first inner harbour is the fishing port where fresh fish comes in every day and the rugged character is visible. There are nice cafés and restaurants around the second harbour, and sailing boats are moored there. There are also new apartment buildings with beautiful views. In the future there will be different kinds of dwellings appearing around the third harbour in a unique new development area.,
‘Bad’ boasts the historic Kurhaus, a cinema and the Circus Theater. These, together with the beautiful revamped promenade and the many beach pavilions, make this the tourism centre of Scheveningen. However, the residents of the district often also seek out the friendly hustle and bustle for a night out or just a stroll. ,
,PUBLIC TRANSPORT,
There are several public transport options in and around Scheveningen, with transport to the center of The Hague, Holland Spoor and Central Station:  ,
,
,Tram 1, 11, 16 ,
,Bus 22, 61,

                                                        ,Seven 'unique' luxury apartments have been realized in the Van Eeghenstraat in one of the most beautiful spots in Amsterdam Oud-Zuid, on the edge of the famous Vondelpark. The design of the houses was provided by 'HEYLIGERS' architects.,

,Area:,
Van Eeghenstraat 29B and 31 are located in the Oud-Zuid district. It is a quiet, green and friendly neighborhood. Amsterdam Oud-Zuid is one of the most prestigious neighborhoods to live in in the city! The houses are located in the heart of the Museum Quarter. The house is located on the edge of the Vondelpark, in the immediate vicinity of the Museumplein and various luxury shopping streets (including Cornelis Schuytstraat, P.C. Hooftstraat and Van Baerlestraat). From a cultural point of view, you are also in a super location with the Concertgebouw around the corner, as well as the internationally renowned museums: the Rijksmuseum, Stedelijk Museum and Van Gogh Museum. For daily shopping you can go to the Albert Hein on the Museumplein or Marqt on the Overtoom. The houses are easily accessible by public transport (trams and buses) and by car you can easily reach the A-10 ring road, A-2, A-4 and Schiphol Airport via the various roads.,
,Project information:,
The renovation concerns two individual buildings: Van Eeghenstraat 29B and 31. A large-scale renovation has ensured that the buildings once again meet the requirements of today and at the same time retain their unique appearance. Both the exterior and the interior have been restored and where necessary renewed. New roofs, window frames and fronts have been installed, the masonry has been repaired and the floors have been reinforced. At the rear, the current balconies have been completely renovated.,
,During the renovation, a lot of attention is paid to sustainability. The floors, roofs and walls have been re-insulated. All apartments have underfloor heating and LED lighting.,
,A style of its own:,
All apartments have been given a high-quality finish and a completely individual style. The style was designed by Heyligers Architects and can best be described as 'Amsterdam chic meets Scandinavian minimalism'. A style that stands for many details, moldings and clean lines, for natural materials, minimalism and for serene tranquility. Many light shades have been used in the apartments, which are combined with dark, steel fronts. In contrast to normal, clear glass, ribbed glass has been used in the steel facade, which creates a special atmosphere. The light oak floor laid in a Hungarian point, the white panel doors, the moldings around the windows and doors and the classic skirting boards provide a luxurious look. Everything has been taken into account in the apartments. For example, they are equipped with a walk-in closet and niches that offer space for decorative cabinets.,
,Kitchen:,
The kitchen is a combination of matte light gray kitchen fronts, a thin composite sand-colored worktop with light veins through which the sink runs. A brass Quooker tap completes this ton-sur-ton kitchen and will give it its own look that seamlessly matches the atmosphere in the rest of the apartment.,
,Bathroom:,
Where light shades predominate in the apartment, darker shades are used in the bathroom. For example, the walls of the shower and sink are fitted with dark wall tiles. By alternating this with a Hungarian point and cross bond, a playful effect is created. White ceramic tiles with a light gray vein have been chosen for the other walls and the floor, which, together with the bronze taps, provide a chic look. The light-dark contrast is also reflected in the washbasin furniture: slightly ribbed wooden drawers and a black marble top. The free-standing bath, separate shower and double sink complete the picture.,

,Living in a completely modern renovated, historic and characteristic warehouse from the 18th century on the charming and quiet Prinseneiland? Then this apartment is definitely something for you!,
,The warehouse Prinseneiland 5, called 'De Jonge Walvisvanger', was built between 1716 and 1721 by Abraham Kromhuijsen. The shell (facade and side walls, beams, floors, staircase and roof construction) largely dates back to this construction phase. The monumental warehouse has a rich history with many functions, from storing coffee and cocoa to framing and housing for a residential group.,
,The national monument has recently been restored to a high standard and sustainably restored into twelve beautiful luxury apartments. For example, an elevator has been installed, energy-efficient installations have been used, all facades, ceilings and floors have been insulated (soundproof) and HR++ insulating glass has been used where possible. By preserving the original 18th century stairs, floor beams and warehouse doors, the characteristic appearance has been preserved.,
,Location,
,The warehouse is located on one of the three Western Islands in the centre of Amsterdam. These islands form a small atmospheric world in themselves. Nowadays, due to its secluded location, it is one of the most sought-after, quietest and most atmospheric neighbourhoods in Amsterdam. You can do your daily shopping on foot on the pleasant Haarlemmerdijk, Haarlemmerstraat and in the Jordaan behind it, where you can also find numerous cafés, restaurants and shops.,
,Prinseneiland is 10 minutes from Central Station and the nearest bus stop on Haarlemmerplein is only 400 metres away.,
,It is a nice place to live quietly, but due to its central location it is a wonderful base for a dynamic life.,
,Layout,
,Via a high-quality upholstered and painted staircase with a modern lift, you reach the entrance of the apartment on the 4th floor.,
,The bathroom and bedroom are located in the entrance hall. The bedroom is spacious and has a large built-in wardrobe. The bathroom is also spacious and equipped with a walk-in shower, a wall-mounted toilet, a large sink with storage space, a good extractor fan and connections for a washing machine and a dryer.,
Then you reach the spacious living room over the entire width of the building, equipped with a spacious dining kitchen, large windows with a beautiful view of the attractive courtyards and a second room.,
Despite the authentic feeling that the building gives you, the kitchen is characterized by its modern character. The stylish color combinations are a feast for the eyes. The modern kitchen has a natural stone top and is also equipped with all desired built-in appliances, such as an oven-microwave combination, fridge-freezer, dishwasher, induction hob and extractor hood. All from the Siemens brand.,
,The house is also fully equipped with beautiful panel doors with stainless steel door and window handles, a high-quality floor finish with high skirting boards, energy-efficient LED built-in lighting and beautiful switching material, as well as an HR CV system, security locks and an intercom with intercom at the entrance door on the ground floor and in the house. In addition, the living room and bedrooms are equipped with curtains.,
,Everything in the house exudes comfort and luxury. A great combination of monumental and modern living pleasure where the apartment has been sustainably renovated (energy label A+, which ensures lower energy costs). The shell and the common areas are sustainably maintained, which includes cleaning the stairwell, maintenance of installations and window cleaning.,

,First floor:,
On the first floor is the entrance to the house, toilet and living / dining room with kitchen. When you enter the apartment from the imposing hall, you immediately notice that the spaciousness (a ceiling height of 4.20 m.) Of the building is continued in the apartment. There is a cloakroom and a modern toilet with a fountain at the entrance. The living / dining room with oak floor is spacious and has a modern open kitchen with a cooking island.

,Brunssum,
There are indications that in prehistoric times there was already habitation in the area around Brunssum. This also applies to the neighboring municipalities of Heerlen and Landgraaf. Little is known about this occupation. Finds from the soil and medieval records indicate an uninterrupted occupation of this area during the last 2,000 years.,
In the Middle Ages, the land defenses in the Schutterspark were erected for protection.,
The parish of Brunssum is known since 1150, and formed with Schinveld and Jabeek a bench of aldermen within the Land of Valkenburg. In 1557, the aldermanic district of Brunssum, consisting of Brunssum, Schinveld and Jabeek, was elevated to a seigniory by the government of the Spanish Netherlands and pledged to the Hoen family of Amstenrade, and sold in 1609 to Arnold III Huyn of Geleen. In 1664, this fiefdom of Brunssum merged into the county of Geleen and Amstenrade. At the end of the ancien régime per 1794 Brunssum became an independent municipality.,
In 1150 there was already a St. Gregory's Church in the center and in 1579 it was elevated to a parish church. The present church is modern.,
Neither seals nor seal images are known from the bench of aldermen or the parish. The coat of arms is therefore composed of the coat of arms of the Huyn family and the parish saint.,
