 The Tolkazerne in Bastion 6 was built as a Tolhuys in 1598. This was to replace a previous “Tolhuys”, which burned down in 1584. 
 The building was used to collect tolls from ships sailing past Gorinchem. Later, the Tolhuys was used as a barracks. 
 In 1425, the Counts of Holland established a toll in Gorinchem. For this purpose, a toll house was built on the west side of the city, where the Linge river flows into the Merwede. The building was part of the castle grounds of the Counts of Holland. 
 After two fires at the end of the 16th century, the building was modernised. Until 1795 it was used as a toll house, after which it was inhabited by a French general and after the French left it was taken into use as a barracks by the Ministry of War in 1814. In the 19th and 20th centuries the building had a varied use; military cholera hospital, civilian school for boys, main building of the position commander of the New Dutch Waterline, a public reading room, tax office and a police station. In 1977 it was transferred to the Vereniging Hendrick de Keyser Monumenten. 
 The building has a picturesque appearance due to the difference in building height, roof shapes and irregular floor plan and is a defining feature of the city silhouette both from the water and from the city. The main part of the complex is located on the Molenstraat. A large cross wing with an octagonal staircase tower was built on this. Both parts of the building were completed in 1598.

That is possible in the robust apartment building on the former Norfolk site! With trendy restaurants, Scheveningen beach, and the global The Hague around the corner. That is coming home to the port of Scheveningen. Will this also be your home port? 
 There are various restaurants around the harbor, from accessible to trendy and luxurious. The Scheveningen harbor is not only a center for the fish trade but also the place where numerous specialty restaurants and eateries are located. The view of the marina, the activity of the fish market, and the fresh sea air make for a unique place to eat out in the Netherlands. 
 In November 2006, 11 years ago, Scheveningen said goodbye to the Norfolkline. What remained behind in Scheveningen was an empty six-hectare site, for which the Municipality of The Hague was looking for a new destination. Now the former Norfolk site is a unique residential location with many facilities around the corner. The access to the new port site is marked by ""the port"", the former Norfolk headquarters. The property has been transformed into 31 unique rental apartments and six luxury penthouses on the third floor. 
The apartments have a variety of types and sizes from approximately 42 m2 to 172 m2. 
 General property description 
Via the centrally located stairwell, which also has a lift, you can reach your apartment via an indoor gallery or corridor. The luxury and bright apartments are finished to a high standard, have energy label A and are ready to move in. The modern bathroom and luxury kitchen offer contemporary comfort.

 De woning: 
 Een ware parel gelegen op eigen grond is met hoogwaardige materialen recent verbouwd tot een moderne, stijlvolle woning die niets aan het toeval overlaat. De indeling van de woning is uniek: op de begane grond vind je een ruime, moderne open keuken die niet alleen praktisch is, maar ook een echte eyecatcher is met een plafondhoogte van 3.14 meter. Het split level ontwerp van de keuken en woonkamer zorgt voor een speelse, authentieke sfeer die je meteen zal aanspreken. 
 De keuken is een droom voor elke kookliefhebber. Met een indrukwekkend 4,5 meter lang RVS aanrechtblad, een inductiekookplaat met ingebouwde afzuigkap, en een Quooker voor direct kokend water, biedt deze ruimte alles wat je nodig hebt om culinaire hoogstandjes te creëren. De ingebouwde wijnklimaatkast en overvloed aan opbergruimte maken het plaatje compleet. 
 De verhoogde woonkamer is knus en gezellig, via de openslaande deuren heb je toegang tot een zonnige tuin op het zuidoosten. Deze verzorgde tuin van ruim 25m² met een majestueuze Esdoorn is de ideale plek om in de middag en avond te genieten van de zon. 
 In het souterrain vind je een comfortabele grote slaapkamer met ruime inloopkast en een werk/logeerkamer. Slapen in het souterrain is heel stil, donker en zomers heerlijk koel. De diverse opbergruimtes waaronder plaats voor de wasmachine en droger en veel ruimte voor opslag van spullen maken deze ruimte helemaal af. 
 De nieuwe badkamer is luxe en stijlvol afgewerkt, met vloerverwarming, een inloopdouche, wastafelmeubel en zelfs een spiegel met verwarming en ingebouwde speakers. Hier vind je alles om je dag op de best mogelijke manier te beginnen én te eindigen. 
 De omgeving: 
 Het bruisende hart van de Pijp ligt letterlijk om de hoek. Met de Albert Cuypmarkt, het Sarphatipark en een enorm aanbod aan cafés, restaurants en boetiekjes, zul je je hier nooit vervelen.

 Elegance, comfort, and sustainability: three words that perfectly describe these five luxury rental apartments. This former office building has been thoroughly renovated over the past few years under architectural supervision, resulting in five high-end rental homes that leave nothing to be desired. All residences are brand new and stylishly furnished, equipped with their own heat pumps with underfloor heating (and cooling!), solar panels, individual internet connections, and very high energy labels (including A ++++). 
 Here, you experience ""turn-key"" living on a new level: stylish, modern, and attention to detail. Located in one of The Hague's most desirable neighborhoods, with excellent (public transport) connections to international schools, shops, and restaurants. Think, for example, of the cozy Reinkenstraat and the Regentesseplein. 
 Will you be the first resident of one of these beautiful apartments? Respond quickly, and we will gladly give you a tour. 
 This advertisement describes Laan van Meerdervoort 342A: 
 Entrance at street level, main front door. Hallway with access to the apartment’s front door. Behind the entrance is the living room with a bedroom located. The living room is situated at the front of the apartment and is very bright.

 The house enjoys a unique privilege with its location on quiet swimming and sailing waters, including a private jetty of 14 m². In the summer, this place invites the children to endless swimming sessions, or jump on your SUP board for a trip around IJburg. The possibility of mooring a boat and sailing onto the IJmeer, perhaps towards Amsterdam, adds an extra charm. 
 A generous, fully enclosed garden of 59 m² invites children to play freely, creating a windless, sun-drenched oasis. Located at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac, it is the perfect place for safe outdoor activities.

The three rooms offer flexibility for sleep or play, and a full bathroom with a shower and bath, a separate toilet with bidet and a concrete floor with underfloor heating ensure comfort and fun. The 39 m² master floor exudes a spa-like atmosphere with a freestanding bath and separate glass shower cubicle. 
 The spacious built-in storage space, the bed in the bay window with a view of the water and the TV on the ceiling with an automated swivel arm enhance the luxury of this floor. The sun-drenched 19 m² roof terrace, ready for a jacuzzi, offers an ideal setting for relaxing under the sun amid tranquil surroundings. Above the garage is an independent studio of 28 m², equipped with heating and water connection. This space is ideal as a sleeping area for teenagers or in-laws, or as a home office with a view of the garden. 
 The house is fully equipped with CAT6 network cabling and offers several 1GB fiber optic internet providers, making it ideal for working from home.

                                                         Luxurious and spacious semi-detached house at Karl Millockerhof 19 in the popular Terwijde-West district of Utrecht, available from February 14 for € 3,950 per month excluding. 
 This modern house of 185m², built in 2004, offers all the comfort you need for a luxurious and practical life. The house has five spacious bedrooms, a large living room, a modern open kitchen, a small backyard facing north and a large front garden and a balcony facing south. In addition, the house is equipped with smart technologies that make daily life easier and more efficient. 
 What makes this house extra special is the extensive ""smart home"" functionality. Almost all aspects of the house can be controlled remotely with a mobile app. Think of a smart front door lock with fingerprint scanner from Nuki, with which you can open the door remotely, and Tado thermostats for the radiators and convector pits in the living room, so that you can easily regulate the temperature per room. This system is not only energy efficient, but also offers the possibility to set automatic clock times for the heating per room. The automatic garage door and roller shutter on the second floor are connected to Somfy Tahoma, and the air conditioning in the office and bedroom on the top floor works via the Daikin ONECTA app. Philips Hue has been chosen for lighting in almost all rooms, so you can adjust the atmosphere in the house at the touch of a button. In the bathroom, toilet and hallway on each floor, the lights switch on and off automatically, which is both practical and energy efficient. Safety is also central: Google Nest Protect smoke and CO2 detectors have been installed in the living room, hallway and on the first and second floors, for extra peace of mind. Google Nest cameras have been placed in the front garden, back garden and in the hallway (active when the residents are not at home), and the smart video doorbell ensures that you can always see who is at the door. In addition, there is a Google security system that works with smart tags to easily switch the alarm on and off. Motion sensors in the living room and hallway on all three floors provide an extra layer of security. 
 Upon entering through the covered entrance, the light and space are immediately noticeable. The hall, with vide, toilet and staircase, provides access to the spacious living room. The living room covers the entire length of the house and has a beautiful wooden parquet floor. Large glass facades at the front and back of the house provide an abundance of natural light and provide access to the sunny front garden facing south. The garden is well maintained, with a terrace, grass and borders, ideal for summer days and relaxing evenings. 
 At the rear of the living room is the open Siematic kitchen, which is equipped with a cooking island and high-quality Siemens built-in appliances. This modern kitchen offers everything you need for a practical and stylish cooking experience. In addition, the patio door to the garden ensures that you can easily move from inside to outside, which significantly increases the living space. 
 On the first floor you will find three spacious bedrooms, all of which have wooden parquet floors. The bedroom at the front offers a beautiful view of the green strip and has a corner window frame. The bathroom on this floor is fully equipped with a bath, walk-in shower, double sink and a second toilet. 
 On the second floor there are two more bedrooms, the largest of which extends across the entire width of the house. This room could possibly be 
divided into two separate bedrooms, which would increase the number of bedrooms to six. The second floor also has a practical laundry room and access to a south-facing roof terrace, where you can enjoy the sun to the fullest.

Situated in an excellent location in the middle of the city, we offer this phenomenal penthouse of 200 m2 for rent, with stunning views at both the front and rear. It has a beautiful living room with open kitchen, equipped with all conceivable appliances and a direct view of the Malieveld, 2 spacious bedrooms, 2 luxurious bathrooms, a separate toilet and an elevator that provides direct access to the penthouse. This penthouse also has an extremely high ridge (more than 4 meters high!) with original beam construction. 
 PIECE OF HISTORY 
When you enter this special building you immediately feel the history. The mainly 18th-century interior, with plastered ceilings, paneling and beautiful wall paintings, is still largely intact. From 1916 to the early 1990s, the building served as an office for the Red Cross. Prince Hendrik and Former Queen Juliana held offices in the building as chairman of the Red Cross from 1916 to 1940.

 Description provided by lessor and conditions: 
 We have a spacious family home with a lovely large backyard facing northeast. In the garden, you'll find our shed and bike shelter, our chicken coop, two seating areas (one of which is covered), and play equipment for our son. The house consists of a small hallway leading to the spacious kitchen, laundry room, and large living room. The kitchen is fully equipped and offers ample storage space. All our appliances and dinnerware will remain in the house during our trip. 
 The laundry room has extra storage, an additional sink, and is also where the central heating unit is located. The living room features a play area (toys can remain in consultation), a large cabinet with games and books (which will also stay), a dining table for eight people, and a cozy sitting area by the stove. From the living room, you can access the hallway, which leads to the toilet and a sliding door to our master bedroom. The master bedroom has a bed for three people and four wardrobes (which will, of course, be emptied). The wall-mounted cupboards contain bedding, which we will leave behind. 
 On the first floor, you'll find a study with two fully equipped workstations, a bedroom with a double bed and enough closet space for two people, and a children's room with a semi-loft bed (with a play cave/hut underneath). Additionally, there is a bathroom with a toilet, a sink with cabinet, a bathtub (with a hand shower), and a separate walk-in shower. We use the attic for storage, so it is excluded from the rental agreement. 
 Both the living room and the first floor have air conditioning units that can heat and cool. The bathroom and laundry room are equipped with infrared heating panels. The house is well insulated, with cavity wall insulation and underfloor insulation, and there are 14 solar panels on the roof. 
 In the vicinity of our house, you'll find several bus stops that can take you to the Efteling or the central station of Den Bosch. The swimming pool, sports clubs, nature areas, hospital, and major roads (A59) are within walking or biking distance. The village of Vlijmen offers all conveniences: supermarkets, restaurants, and places for takeout/delivery. There are several ATMs in the village and a variety of shops for daily and less common needs. The Helftheuvelpassage shopping center in Den Bosch West is also within biking distance. 
 In short: a fantastic place to live (temporarily). 
 Rental price 
 The rental price is excluding gas/water/electricity, but including service costs. 
 Deposit

 SELECTION PROCEDURE: 
 Rotsvast will determine based on incoming emails which candidates responded first. Given the estimated large number of responses, not all candidates can be invited. This email must contain at least the following information: 
 
 Name of tenant(s) 
 Explanation of composition of household 
 Gross annual income of tenant(s) 
 
 Responses that do not meet these requirements will not be processed. 
 Invitations will be sent in order of incoming emails and for a viewing round, it applies: first come, first served. 
 After the viewing, income and reliability will be screened in various (public) registers. The tenant must complete and successfully pass this screening with 5 stars, the highest score in our screening tool (Properize). The choice to rent the property to candidates is entirely up to the owner of the property. If multiple candidates pass the screening successfully, the choice will be based on both income, screening, and the tenant's personal situation. As a tenant, you have the opportunity to explain your personal situation during the screening. 
 Candidates who do not get allocated the property after screening have the right to further explanation and, of course, they can view the screening report. 
 PLEASE NOTE:  Rotsvast represents the interests of the owner, who has an interest in rental by the available date. If a screening has been completed in full, Rotsvast will immediately propose a dossier to the owner. If a dossier has already been accepted, dossiers that come in complete after this will no longer be included in the process. It is the responsibility of candidate tenants to provide a complete dossier as soon as possible. Rotsvast will not actively inform tenants about the progress of the ongoing screening process of other candidate tenants. In a tight housing market, Rotsvast assumes that candidate tenants are aware of the importance of acting promptly.

Modern homes provide a residence for young professionals, vreewijk residents looking to upgrade, and expats. 
 Historical background: 
built in 1923, the hillehof was once the largest school complex in rotterdam (6000m2). Designed by architects walter dahlen and ad van der steur, they contributed to various schools in Rotterdam, including the bergsingel and the maritime school. Originally, the building housed three schools and featured classrooms, a gymnasium, a bathhouse, two staff houses, and a covered children's playground. 
 Vreewijk is known for its unique urban and architectural design, being a historic garden city district. It was one of the first garden city developments in the netherlands, designed in the early 20th century. Zuidplein shopping center, with its numerous shops, is around the corner, and the metro stopping at this shopping center takes you to rotterdam central station and the city center in 10 minutes. Close to various highways (a15 + a16) and multiple bus stops (within walking distance). 
 layout: 
The entrance to the loft can be made from the courtyard adjacent to vorkstraat, where you can enter the living room, or through a small courtyard adjacent to ploegstraat, allowing you to enter the apartment through the kitchen. This apartment has large window areas on all sides. On the ground floor, you'll find the living room and kitchen. The kitchen is equipped with modern appliances, such as a microwave oven and dishwasher. A staircase leads to a mezzanine where, on one side, you have a fully furnished sleeping area with a double bed, and on the other side, a workspace with a desk. The new and elegant bathroom features a walk-in shower, toilet, and sink with a mirror.

 About the project 
WesterparkWest 
In WesterparkWest, you live with all the comforts and facilities of the city, in the greenery of an urban square with everything you need. A good cup of coffee on the terrace, running routes through the park, in the middle of urban life with all the space and comfort. 
The old office area serves as the raw material for a new, modern residential area. From closed to open. From grey and gloomy to green and relaxed. From workplace to a relaxed residential, working and living environment. 
 One prime location, seven residential buildings 
WesterparkWest offers a wide range of high-quality rental housing spread across seven unique residential buildings: Salt, Pepper, Blend and the four Basil buildings (North, East, South and West). Together, these buildings offer 552 flats, each with its own character and appeal. Whether you are young, old, single or living together, here you will find a home that suits you. The homes range from 1-, 2-, 3- and even 4-room flats and are designed with the modern resident in mind. 
A significant proportion of the flats in Basil (95 of the 250 homes) are available for middle-income earners, according to the guidelines of the Amsterdam municipality. These homes are subject to a maximum income limit of €75,362 (price level 2024). In addition, a number of free sector flats offer the option of being shared by two house-sharing tenants. 
 Sustainable and comfortable living 
All buildings in WesterparkWest combine comfort with sustainability. The flats are connected to a WKO system, which provides regulated heating in winter and cooling in summer. They have excellent ventilation and have at least energy label A, with some homes even achieving A++ or A+++. Solar panels on the roofs provide energy for general facilities, making the buildings contribute to a more sustainable future. NOTE: Tenants enter into a separate, separate agreement with Unica for the WKO system. The agreement, rates and conditions will be shared when the rental agreement is sent. 
 Unique living comfort 
Each flat offers fantastic views and a carefree living experience. Smart layouts, modern amenities and a peaceful living environment make WesterparkWest a place where everyone feels at home in the heart of Amsterdam. You can easily store your bicycle under the complex. If you have an electric bike, you can easily charge the loose battery in a locker. For car enthusiasts, a private parking space is additionally available for rent. The monthly rent is € 175 (plus € 15 service charge per month). 
 In the green 
Westerpark is literally at your feet. Westerpark West is built and designed as a very high-quality place to live, work and recreate. Picnicking with your friends, playing football with the children, running laps with your neighbours or quietly enjoying the view from your own terrace: it's all possible here. We try to make ‘time’ here into Quality Time in every way possible. We do this with good facilities for the entire neighbourhood (think catering establishments, day nurseries) and smart, comfortable buildings (use of sustainable installations and state-of-the-art technology). In addition, we examine whether and how we can provide a possible programme of shared and personal services, such as cleaning and concierge services. 
 Location 
Everything within walking distance and by bike you will experience a wide variety of city activities within 15 minutes. Fine dining, cinema, theatre, strolling, concerts Amsterdam offers so much and from WesterParkWest everything is within easy reach. If you do want to get out of the city, the motorway, train or metro are within easy reach. 
 Income standard 
For this project, the (joint) gross monthly income must be at least equal to 3.5 times the basic monthly rent. We do not take equity and guarantees into account. Entrepreneurs must have been active for at least 2 years.

 About the livingspace 
An apartment on location ""Overtoomse Veld Zuid"" in Amsterdam 
 About the project 
LOCATION 
The building is located in the Nieuw-West district, just outside the Amsterdam ring road. Supermarkets and nice cosy shops and restaurants are in the immediate vicinity. In addition, there is plenty of greenery within walking distance; on one side of the building the Sloterplas with surrounding park and on the other side the Rembrandtpark with its beautiful ponds, lawns and playgrounds and which also offers a 'green' cycling route to the city centre. The centre of Amsterdam is only 15 minutes away by bike from the apartment. At a short distance from the building are several bus, tram and metro stops via which you can be door-to-door at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport in half an hour, as well as Amsterdam Central Station. By car, you can reach the A10 motorway within minutes. 
 OUR SERVICES 
The Tenant Ambassadors from To Be At are at your service every day to provide you with an optimal living experience. Whether it's carrying out a repair request in your home, directing the cleaning when an accident has happened or just having a chat, they are happy to do so. You speak to them in the atrium, create a ticket in our own resident app or send a chat message - getting in touch has never been easier! 
With our services, we make your life easier and more fun! For example, we offer various services such as the Miele Laundry Boutique, a shared laundry facility, MyPup lockers, for receiving and sending packages in a safe and sustainable way, and you can book our cleaning service for cleaning your studio. 
Already interested in renting an apartment? Check if you are eligible and sign up to rent! 
 OUR COMMUNITY 
We're on a mission to reintroduce the element of community in urban apartment living. The ecosystem we create, helps you interact with your fellow residents while protecting your personal space. From cozy get-to-gethers to big events with your neighbors; we believe that life is infinitely more joyful when we're truly connected and never need to feel alone. 
The building has an atrium where you can work and enjoy a snack from the vending machines. Next to the atrium is the communal living room, which invites you to relax, watch a movie or play a game with your fellow residents. 
Both areas are designed to encourage interaction so you can connect with your neighbours. Both spaces are currently undergoing an 'upgrade'. They are being completely repainted and fitted with new furniture, so that these spaces can be even better used by the community and you too can really feel at home there. 
 WHAT WILL THE RENT OF AN APARTMENT COST ME? 
The basic rent is EUR 805 per month. 
In addition, you pay a service charge of EUR 176 (including EUR 45 for heating) per month. These costs are charged for the services offered, such as the caretakers (Tenant Ambassadors), cleaning, security, flooring, sunblind but also for internet and heating in your apartment. 
Service costs are an advance payment. Every year, you will receive an overview of the actual costs incurred. If applicable, the costs will be settled. 
You enter into a rent contract for one year. After that, the contract can be terminated monthly. 
There is a possibility to apply for rent allowance. Whether you are eligible for a rent allowance is of course entirely dependent on your income, you can calculate this on the website of the Dutch tax authorities. 
 AM I ELIGIBLE TO RENT AN APARTMENT? 
You are eligible to rent an apartment if you meet all these conditions: 
 
 
 I am a young professional (age 18-36 years old) 
 
 
 I am looking for a living environment with a community of like-minded people 
 
 
 I earn a gross salary of EUR 3.220 per month 
 
 
 I want to rent for at least one year 
 
 
 In this project, guaranteeing eligibility is not possible!  
 
 
 PLEASE NOTE: because the basic rent is social rent, a housing permit is necessary for every tenant. Your annual income must therefore not be too high, among other things (limit: gross annual income €57,926 for 2025). Avoid disappointment afterwards, so read more information on the Amsterdam website!

 About the project 
Welcome to Domūs Houthaven 
Views of the city centre on one side and Amsterdam's harbours on the other. Domūs Houthaven is located in the middle of the new sustainable city district, right next to the centre of Amsterdam. With 235 rental flats and various communal areas and services, everything here is geared towards modern city living. Properties are regularly available.

Domūs Houthaven features a diversity of flats. Ranging from 40 sqm to 60 sqm. All homes come with solid PVC flooring, curtains and the ‘smart living core’ with kitchen, bathroom, cupboards, and bed. So ready to move into. 
 With many extras 
Living at Domūs is living with many extra amenities. In the living room and roof garden, you walk in to work for a while or meet others. The other facilities work on a ‘pay per use’ basis. So no unnecessarily high service costs, but only pay for what you actually use. 
 Bringing soul into the building 
Shared spaces and facilities play a key role in Domūs Living. Christa de Buvry de Mauregnault, owner of operator TO BE AT, makes sure everything is arranged and runs smoothly at the venue. ‘The uniqueness of Domūs lies in the combination of a smart, compact home with the possibility of extra living space in the shared living room, cooking studio and garden. This offers residents optimal living pleasure and convenience at the lowest possible ecological footprint. It is great to see that everyone uses those shared extra spaces exactly as they are intended. That goes very organically. As TO BE AT, we are there for the residents, to bring soul to this fantastic building. With hospitality, services and technology. Facility manager Marco is there every day to answer questions and pick up jobs. And community manager Rajeb himself lives in the building. He will help and inspire fellow residents to organise activities. Tenant satisfaction is already high: Domūs scores a 9.3. We are proud of that and want to maintain it!’

Tomorrow's housing solutions go beyond buildings. As a service brand, we are constantly improving the daily lives of residents and our environment.

In WesterparkWest, you live with all the comforts and facilities of the city, in the greenery of an urban square with everything you need. A good cup of coffee on the terrace, running routes through the park, in the middle of urban life with all the space and comfort. 
The old office area serves as the raw material for a new, modern residential area. From closed to open. From grey and gloomy to green and relaxed. From workplace to a relaxed residential, working and living environment. 
 One prime location, seven residential buildings 
WesterparkWest offers a wide range of high-quality rental housing spread across seven unique residential buildings: Salt, Pepper, Blend and the four Basil buildings (North, East, South and West). Together, these buildings offer 552 flats, each with its own character and appeal. Whether you are young, old, single or living together, here you will find a home that suits you. The homes range from 1-, 2-, 3- and even 4-room flats and are designed with the modern resident in mind. 
A significant proportion of the flats in Basil (95 of the 250 homes) are available for middle-income earners, according to the guidelines of the Amsterdam municipality. These homes are subject to a maximum income limit of €75,362 (price level 2024). In addition, a number of free sector flats offer the option of being shared by two house-sharing tenants. 
 Sustainable and comfortable living 
All buildings in WesterparkWest combine comfort with sustainability. The flats are connected to a WKO system, which provides regulated heating in winter and cooling in summer. They have excellent ventilation and have at least energy label A, with some homes even achieving A++ or A+++. Solar panels on the roofs provide energy for general facilities, making the buildings contribute to a more sustainable future. NOTE: Tenants enter into a separate, separate agreement with Unica for the WKO system. The agreement, rates and conditions will be shared when the rental agreement is sent. 
 Unique living comfort 
Each flat offers fantastic views and a carefree living experience. Smart layouts, modern amenities and a peaceful living environment make WesterparkWest a place where everyone feels at home in the heart of Amsterdam. You can easily store your bicycle under the complex. If you have an electric bike, you can easily charge the loose battery in a locker. For car enthusiasts, a private parking space is additionally available for rent. The monthly rent is € 175 (plus € 15 service charge per month). 
 In the green 
Westerpark is literally at your feet. Westerpark West is built and designed as a very high-quality place to live, work and recreate. Picnicking with your friends, playing football with the children, running laps with your neighbours or quietly enjoying the view from your own terrace: it's all possible here. We try to make ‘time’ here into Quality Time in every way possible. We do this with good facilities for the entire neighbourhood (think catering establishments, day nurseries) and smart, comfortable buildings (use of sustainable installations and state-of-the-art technology). In addition, we examine whether and how we can provide a possible programme of shared and personal services, such as cleaning and concierge services. 
 Location 
Everything within walking distance and by bike you will experience a wide variety of city activities within 15 minutes. Fine dining, cinema, theatre, strolling, concerts Amsterdam offers so much and from WesterParkWest everything is within easy reach. If you do want to get out of the city, the motorway, train or metro are within easy reach. 
 Income standard 
For this project, the (joint) gross monthly income must be at least equal to 3.5 times the basic monthly rent. We do not take equity and guarantees into account. Entrepreneurs must have been active for at least 2 years.

 About the project 
Renting a studio in Amsterdam Zuidoost? 
At 801 Elizabeth Cady Stantonplein, you will find this beautiful Young Professional building, completed in 2019. The building is 10 floors high and has around 500 studios specially designed for working young people aged between 18 and 36. The building is sustainable, green and natural gas-free. In this way, the landlord contributes to a green planet. 
 The location 
Amsterdam-Zuidoost is close to various parks such as the Nelson Mandela Park (a 5-minute walk). There is also a nice shopping centre at 1-minute walking distance: Amsterdamse Poort. Amsterdam-Zuidoost is easily accessible by public transport. Both train station and metro station Amsterdam Bijlmer Arena are only a 10-minute walk away. There are also many bus connections, making it easy to reach small nearby towns as well. 
 Our service 
You enter the building with a badge system. At the entrance, you can choose to take the lift to your studio or take the stairs to the atrium. In the spacious atrium, you can meet other residents or find a quiet place to work. Next to the atrium is the communal living room, here too you can meet fellow residents or find some relaxation! 
 DO I QUALIFY TO RENT A FLAT? 
You are eligible to rent a flat if you meet all these conditions: 
 
 I am a young professional (18-36 years old). 
 I am looking for a living environment with a community of like-minded people. 
 I earn a gross monthly salary of at least 3.5 times the basic rent. 
 I want to rent for at least one year. 
 In this project, guaranteeing eligibility is not possible!. 
 
 PLEASE NOTE: because the basic rent is social rent, a housing permit is necessary for every tenant. Your annual income must therefore not be too high, among other things (limit: gross annual income €57,926 for 2025.) Avoid disappointment afterwards, so read more information on the Amsterdam website!

An apartment on location ""Houthavens West"" in Amsterdam 
 About the project 
Welcome to Domūs Houthaven 
Views of the city centre on one side and Amsterdam's harbours on the other. Domūs Houthaven is located in the middle of the new sustainable city district, right next to the centre of Amsterdam. With 235 rental flats and various communal areas and services, everything here is geared towards modern city living. Properties are regularly available. 
 A smart home 
Domūs Houthaven features a diversity of flats. Ranging from 40 sqm to 60 sqm. All homes come with solid PVC flooring, curtains and the ‘smart living core’ with kitchen, bathroom, cupboards, and bed. So ready to move into. 
 With many extras 
Living at Domūs is living with many extra amenities. In the living room and roof garden, you walk in to work for a while or meet others. The other facilities work on a ‘pay per use’ basis. So no unnecessarily high service costs, but only pay for what you actually use. 
 Bringing soul into the building 
Shared spaces and facilities play a key role in Domūs Living. Christa de Buvry de Mauregnault, owner of operator TO BE AT, makes sure everything is arranged and runs smoothly at the venue. ‘The uniqueness of Domūs lies in the combination of a smart, compact home with the possibility of extra living space in the shared living room, cooking studio and garden. This offers residents optimal living pleasure and convenience at the lowest possible ecological footprint. It is great to see that everyone uses those shared extra spaces exactly as they are intended. That goes very organically. As TO BE AT, we are there for the residents, to bring soul to this fantastic building. With hospitality, services and technology. Facility manager Marco is there every day to answer questions and pick up jobs. And community manager Rajeb himself lives in the building. He will help and inspire fellow residents to organise activities. Tenant satisfaction is already high: Domūs scores a 9.3. We are proud of that and want to maintain it!’

Tomorrow's housing solutions go beyond buildings. As a service brand, we are constantly improving the daily lives of residents and our environment.

A two-room apartment on location ""Coenhaven/Mercuriushaven"" in Amsterdam 
 About the project 
Welcome to Domūs Houthaven 
Views of the city centre on one side and Amsterdam's harbours on the other. Domūs Houthaven is located in the middle of the new sustainable city district, right next to the centre of Amsterdam. With 235 rental flats and various communal areas and services, everything here is geared towards modern city living. Properties are regularly available. 
 A smart home 
Domūs Houthaven features a diversity of flats. Ranging from 40 sqm to 60 sqm. All homes come with solid PVC flooring, curtains and the ‘smart living core’ with kitchen, bathroom, cupboards, and bed. So ready to move into. 
 With many extras 
Living at Domūs is living with many extra amenities. In the living room and roof garden, you walk in to work for a while or meet others. The other facilities work on a ‘pay per use’ basis. So no unnecessarily high service costs, but only pay for what you actually use. 
 Bringing soul into the building 
Shared spaces and facilities play a key role in Domūs Living. Christa de Buvry de Mauregnault, owner of operator TO BE AT, makes sure everything is arranged and runs smoothly at the venue. ‘The uniqueness of Domūs lies in the combination of a smart, compact home with the possibility of extra living space in the shared living room, cooking studio and garden. This offers residents optimal living pleasure and convenience at the lowest possible ecological footprint. It is great to see that everyone uses those shared extra spaces exactly as they are intended. That goes very organically. As TO BE AT, we are there for the residents, to bring soul to this fantastic building. With hospitality, services and technology. Facility manager Marco is there every day to answer questions and pick up jobs. And community manager Rajeb himself lives in the building. He will help and inspire fellow residents to organise activities. Tenant satisfaction is already high: Domūs scores a 9.3. We are proud of that and want to maintain it!’

 About the project 
WesterparkWest 
In WesterparkWest, you live with all the comforts and facilities of the city, in the greenery of an urban square with everything you need. A good cup of coffee on the terrace, running routes through the park, in the middle of urban life with all the space and comfort. 
The old office area serves as the raw material for a new, modern residential area. From closed to open. From grey and gloomy to green and relaxed. From workplace to a relaxed residential, working and living environment. 
 One prime location, seven residential buildings 
WesterparkWest offers a wide range of high-quality rental housing spread across seven unique residential buildings: Salt, Pepper, Blend and the four Basil buildings (North, East, South and West). Together, these buildings offer 552 flats, each with its own character and appeal. Whether you are young, old, single or living together, here you will find a home that suits you. The homes range from 1-, 2-, 3- and even 4-room flats and are designed with the modern resident in mind. 
A significant proportion of the flats in Basil (95 of the 250 homes) are available for middle-income earners, according to the guidelines of the Amsterdam municipality. These homes are subject to a maximum income limit of €75,362 (price level 2024). In addition, a number of free sector flats offer the option of being shared by two house-sharing tenants. 
 Sustainable and comfortable living 
All buildings in WesterparkWest combine comfort with sustainability. The flats are connected to a WKO system, which provides regulated heating in winter and cooling in summer. They have excellent ventilation and have at least energy label A, with some homes even achieving A++ or A+++. Solar panels on the roofs provide energy for general facilities, making the buildings contribute to a more sustainable future. NOTE: Tenants enter into a separate, separate agreement with Unica for the WKO system. The agreement, rates and conditions will be shared when the rental agreement is sent. 
 Unique living comfort 
Each flat offers fantastic views and a carefree living experience. Smart layouts, modern amenities and a peaceful living environment make WesterparkWest a place where everyone feels at home in the heart of Amsterdam. You can easily store your bicycle under the complex. If you have an electric bike, you can easily charge the loose battery in a locker. For car enthusiasts, a private parking space is additionally available for rent. The monthly rent is € 175 (plus € 15 service charge per month). 
 In the green 
Westerpark is literally at your feet. Westerpark West is built and designed as a very high-quality place to live, work and recreate. Picnicking with your friends, playing football with the children, running laps with your neighbours or quietly enjoying the view from your own terrace: it's all possible here. We try to make ‘time’ here into Quality Time in every way possible. We do this with good facilities for the entire neighbourhood (think catering establishments, day nurseries) and smart, comfortable buildings (use of sustainable installations and state-of-the-art technology). In addition, we examine whether and how we can provide a possible programme of shared and personal services, such as cleaning and concierge services. 
 Location 
Everything within walking distance and by bike you will experience a wide variety of city activities within 15 minutes. Fine dining, cinema, theatre, strolling, concerts Amsterdam offers so much and from WesterParkWest everything is within easy reach. If you do want to get out of the city, the motorway, train or metro are within easy reach. 
 Income standard 
For this project, the (joint) gross monthly income must be at least equal to 3.5 times the basic monthly rent. We do not take equity and guarantees into account. Entrepreneurs must have been active for at least 2 years.

 About the livingspace 
An apartment on location ""Overtoomse Veld Zuid"" in Amsterdam 
 About the project 
LOCATION 
The building is located in the Nieuw-West district, just outside the Amsterdam ring road. Supermarkets and nice cosy shops and restaurants are in the immediate vicinity. In addition, there is plenty of greenery within walking distance; on one side of the building the Sloterplas with surrounding park and on the other side the Rembrandtpark with its beautiful ponds, lawns and playgrounds and which also offers a 'green' cycling route to the city centre. The centre of Amsterdam is only 15 minutes away by bike from the apartment. At a short distance from the building are several bus, tram and metro stops via which you can be door-to-door at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport in half an hour, as well as Amsterdam Central Station. By car, you can reach the A10 motorway within minutes. 
 OUR SERVICES 
The Tenant Ambassadors from To Be At are at your service every day to provide you with an optimal living experience. Whether it's carrying out a repair request in your home, directing the cleaning when an accident has happened or just having a chat, they are happy to do so. You speak to them in the atrium, create a ticket in our own resident app or send a chat message - getting in touch has never been easier! 
With our services, we make your life easier and more fun! For example, we offer various services such as the Miele Laundry Boutique, a shared laundry facility, MyPup lockers, for receiving and sending packages in a safe and sustainable way, and you can book our cleaning service for cleaning your studio. 
Already interested in renting an apartment? Check if you are eligible and sign up to rent! 
 OUR COMMUNITY 
We're on a mission to reintroduce the element of community in urban apartment living. The ecosystem we create, helps you interact with your fellow residents while protecting your personal space. From cozy get-to-gethers to big events with your neighbors; we believe that life is infinitely more joyful when we're truly connected and never need to feel alone. 
The building has an atrium where you can work and enjoy a snack from the vending machines. Next to the atrium is the communal living room, which invites you to relax, watch a movie or play a game with your fellow residents. 
Both areas are designed to encourage interaction so you can connect with your neighbours. Both spaces are currently undergoing an 'upgrade'. They are being completely repainted and fitted with new furniture, so that these spaces can be even better used by the community and you too can really feel at home there. 
 WHAT WILL THE RENT OF AN APARTMENT COST ME? 
The basic rent is EUR 805 per month. 
In addition, you pay a service charge of EUR 176 (including EUR 45 for heating) per month. These costs are charged for the services offered, such as the caretakers (Tenant Ambassadors), cleaning, security, flooring, sunblind but also for internet and heating in your apartment. 
Service costs are an advance payment. Every year, you will receive an overview of the actual costs incurred. If applicable, the costs will be settled. 
You enter into a rent contract for one year. After that, the contract can be terminated monthly. 
There is a possibility to apply for rent allowance. Whether you are eligible for a rent allowance is of course entirely dependent on your income, you can calculate this on the website of the Dutch tax authorities. 
 AM I ELIGIBLE TO RENT AN APARTMENT? 
You are eligible to rent an apartment if you meet all these conditions: 
 
 
 I am a young professional (age 18-36 years old) 
 
 
 I am looking for a living environment with a community of like-minded people 
 
 
 I earn a gross salary of EUR 3.220 per month 
 
 
 I want to rent for at least one year 
 
 
 In this project, guaranteeing eligibility is not possible!  
 
 
 PLEASE NOTE: because the basic rent is social rent, a housing permit is necessary for every tenant. Your annual income must therefore not be too high, among other things (limit: gross annual income €57,926 for 2025). Avoid disappointment afterwards, so read more information on the Amsterdam website!

                                                         ARCHITECTURALLY DESIGNED AND FURNISHED APARTMENT AVAILABLE ON KORTE NOODGODSSTRAAT IN GOUDA 
 On Korte Noodgodsstraat in Gouda, you will find this spacious apartment of 131 m², featuring two bedrooms and an indoor outdoor space. However, it’s not the size of this city-center apartment that makes it special, nor the fact that this maisonette includes an indoor outdoor space. No, it’s the unique design of the apartment that we would like to highlight. Words cannot do justice to the quality and appeal of this home, so we warmly invite you to take a look at the photos in this advertisement. 
 Still curious about how we describe this property? Read on: 
 Through the central entrance with an intercom system and mailboxes, you enter the former post office on Korte Noodgodsstraat, located in the heart of Gouda’s city center. The front door of this property is situated on the first floor of the complex, where you will find a spacious hallway with a cloakroom, toilet, and utility meter cupboard. 
 From the hallway, you enter the spacious and open living room, from which all living areas of the home are visible. The space is equipped with large windows spanning the entire facade, allowing for ample natural light. The use of glass walls allows light to flow freely throughout the home. 
 The living room, featuring a stylish poured floor, is spacious enough to comfortably accommodate both a seating area and a dining area. The kitchen has an open design and an industrial look, thanks to the extensive use of stainless steel. It is equipped with a 90 cm-wide induction hob with a large oven, an extractor hood, a dishwasher, a luxury mixer tap, and plenty of cabinet space. 
 On the second floor, accessible via the characteristic spiral staircase in the center of the living room, you will find two spacious bedrooms, a large landing ideal for creating a workspace, and the bathroom. A nice detail is that from your shower, you have a beautiful view of the rest of the home, while still enjoying the privacy you need in a bathroom. The bathroom is completed with a double sink, a separate toilet, and a utility area with connections for a washing machine and dryer. 
 An important feature to highlight is the indoor outdoor space in the living room. In the photos, you’ll recognize this area by the lounge set. This space is fully insulated from your home, and if desired, the windows can be left open 24/7. With a favorable sun orientation, it’s even possible to place outdoor plants here and see them bloom beautifully. Thanks to its sheltered location, you can enjoy this outdoor space early in the spring and late into the autumn. The apartment’s windows face the southwest side of the building and are equipped with external sunshades. 
 SPECIAL FEATURES 
 
 This property is offered for an indefinite period with a minimum rental term of 12 months. 
 You pay a utility advance of €275 per month for gas, water, and electricity, with an annual settlement. 
 This property includes a storage space on the ground floor of the complex.

 Explanation of the household composition. 
 Gross annual income of tenant(s). 
 
 Responses that do not meet these requirements will not be considered.

 Candidates not selected after the screening have the right to request an explanation and review the screening report. 
 NOTE:  Rotsvast represents the landlord, whose priority is renting the property as soon as it becomes available. Once a fully approved dossier is submitted, Rotsvast will present it to the landlord immediately. If a dossier is already accepted, new applications will not be considered. It is the responsibility of prospective tenants to submit a complete application promptly. Rotsvast will not actively inform candidates about the progress of the screening process for others. In a competitive housing market, timely action is expected from prospective tenants.

 Geleen 
Geleen (Limburg: Gelaen) is a place and former municipality in the Dutch province of Limburg. It owes its name (originally ""Op-geleen"", the current Old Geleen) to its location at the Geleen River (also called the Geleenbeek), which formed the eastern border of the municipality. The place includes the former village cores Oud-Geleen, Lutterade, Krawinkel, Spaans Neerbeek and Daniken, and around them the neighbourhoods created in the last century. Anno 2018, 31,815 people live there[1]. In 2018 Geleen covers an area of 1957 hectares of land and thus has a population density of 1626 inhabitants/km². 
On 1 January 2001, Geleen was merged with Sittard and Born to form the new municipality of Sittard-Geleen.
