Completely in line with the latest trends and yet taking into account optimal usability, the landlord of this home has carried out his plan. It is a very bright home because the corner location has many windows. The home is located in a child-friendly neighborhood north of Haarlem Center.  
 This is a beautiful and central location 5 minutes by bike and 15 minutes on foot from the historic center of Haarlem and Central Station. You have all the facilities that Haarlem has to offer within a few minutes walking/cycling distance. Ideal location with regard to various schools, shops and close to highways to Amsterdam, Schiphol, Hoofddorp, etc. The ideal thing about this location is that there is plenty of parking available without the need for a permit. 
 Ground floor: Entrance in hallway which is equipped with authentic vestibule (ideal in winter to avoid the first cold when opening the front door) and wainscoting. Behind the stairs to the first floor you will find a storage cupboard where the washing machine can also be placed. 
 First floor: Central landing which gives access to the modern spacious toilet and the bizarrely light living room, which has a cool appearance due to the contrast of the white walls with the dark window frames, the very sensitive wooden 'herringbone' laid oak floorboards have now been replaced by much better maintained PVC floorboards, modern kitchen with the obvious built-in appliances. Through French doors you enter the south-facing roof terrace (the floor panels and the fencing around the terrace are not yet visible in the photos, but these have now been installed). 
 Second floor: Again a central landing which gives access to a (second) separate modern toilet, three bedrooms and the modern bathroom with bath, separate shower and beautiful washbasin. 
 Special features: 
- Living area of 90m² and volume of 319m³ 
- Rental period is based on an indefinite period with a minimum period of 18 months 
- In addition to the monthly rent, the tenant must take care of the costs of gas, electricity, water, TV/Internet and municipal taxes

 Location: 
During all the city expansions, this authentic little street remained fairly undisturbed, while all the amenities did get closer and closer. The proximity of the city centre, with NS railway station and supermarkets at a few minutes' cycling distance, brings both culture and nature into the immediate vicinity.

                                                         When you think of Amsterdam, you think of the world-famous canal belt. When many centuries ago the canal belt was built as a prestigious new residential area for the wealthy Amsterdammers, it was already a unique and very exclusive plan. The houses are often built as true city palaces, and over the years these monumental buildings have been extensively rebuilt, renovated and divided into apartments. The canal belt offers a nice mix of nationalities and is therefore a very desirable neighborhood to live in. In terms of shops, restaurants as well as parks and public transport: everything is within walking distance. Likewise here. With the Utrechtsestraat on the corner with its many shops and restaurants, the Rembrandtplein, the many museums at the Museumplein, the Hermitage, the theaters and cinema around the Leidseplein: almost everything is in close proximity. 
 LAYOUT: 
The elevator is reached via a stately entrance with beautiful ornaments. The elevator goes to the second floor. Very spacious living room with beautiful ornaments and a view of the canal. Beautiful fireplace, fully equipped and modern kitchen with all imaginable options. Two spacious bedrooms, both with a luxurious bathroom and air conditioning. 
On the ground floor there is a great relaxation area, equipped with a spacious swimming pool with jet function, sauna and whirlpool. There is also a (shared) garden here, which can be used by the residents in consultation. All in all an oasis of peace in the middle of the bustling city center of Amsterdam.

This high-quality renovated and adapted to contemporary needs home has a unique light living room with modern open kitchen, three bedrooms and a spacious bathroom. Ideal location given the possibility to park a car by means of a parking permit to be obtained via the municipality of Haarlem, within a few minutes the highways to Amsterdam, Schiphol, Hoofddorp, Utrecht and The Hague can be reached. Haarlem central station is a few minutes by bike, which also provides a perfect connection to public transport to Amsterdam. Shops for daily necessities, various (primary) schools, sports clubs and recreational facilities are located in the immediate vicinity. The beaches and dunes of Bloemendaal. 
 Ground floor: Entrance hall which gives access to the stairs to the.... 
 First floor: Central landing, spacious modern toilet with washbasin. Lovely light and spacious living room with high ceilings and large windows. At the rear of the house you will find a modern open kitchen set up in L-shape and equipped with various (built-in) appliances, namely: Fridge/freezer, combination oven, induction hob with integrated extractor hood, dishwasher and plenty of cupboard space. Small 'extra' room at the front next to the living room, this room is ideal to set up as a home office or study room. 
 Second floor: Again a central landing which on this floor gives access to two spacious bedrooms at both the rear and the front, modern bathroom with walk-in shower, second toilet and a beautiful washbasin with an illuminated mirror above it. At the front of the house a room specifically furnished as a 'laundry' with a connection for both the washing machine and a dryer. 
 And then perhaps the most beautiful floor, in any case the cosiest: The extra floor is a completely renovated attic room, the original roof trusses divide this room into two parts, which makes it possible to create a very cozy bedroom/living room, of course this entire attic can also be used as storage space, but that would almost be a shame.

Designing houseboat 'Arden', we, as a landlord, set ourselves one goal: to create the perfect houseboat. Space, light comfort are important keywords, and 'contact with the water'. 
 You step aboard this recently renovated houseboat, you leave the hustle and bustle of the city behind and you experience the soothing experience of living on the water. The central hall gives access to the open living room with kitchen, the master bedroom, the toilet and the spacious bathroom. The second bedroom is located on the other side of the living room. This makes the houseboat suitable for families as well as singles who want to share the rent together. 
 The living room has an extensive ambiance through the use of many natural materials and a very wide sliding door that lets in a sea of light. Open this front and meet the many aquatic inhabitants, including grebes, ducks and majestic swans. Take a seat on the comfortable corner sofa and enjoy the fascinating reflection of the water surface on the ceiling - an unexpected extra that every houseboat resident expects. 
 The entire houseboat has underfloor heating, which ensures a very pleasant indoor climate. Even if it is freezing that it cracks, you are inside with wonderfully warm feet. So there is literally no reason for 'cold feet'. 
 The open kitchen with large dining table is excellently equipped for daily use and use in a combination oven, ceramic hob, extractor hood, kitchen utensils, washing machine, coffee, washer-dryer combination. 
 Thanks to Appiani's deep blue Italian tiles, the bathroom definitely has spa features. The rain shower is the sunken bath situated next to the two design washbasins. 
 Both bedrooms have blackout curtains and a double bed that can be placed apart.

 Sittard 
Sittard (Limburgs: Zitterd) is a city in Dutch Limburg, in the transition area between Central Limburg and the South Limburg hills. It is one of the oldest places in the Netherlands and the second oldest city (with city rights) in Limburg. 
Since 2001, Sittard has formed the municipality of Sittard-Geleen, together with the south-western bordering town of Geleen in the former Western Mining Area and a number of smaller towns, including Born. As a result of this merger, the municipality of Sittard-Geleen has become the third largest town in the province in terms of population (approx. 92,661). 
The original hinterland of Sittard forms the historic Land of Zwentibold around the Graetheide. 
Sittard lies exactly wedged between two national borders in the narrowest part of the province of Limburg, also the narrowest part of the Netherlands. To the east and northeast it borders Germany, near the municipality of Selfkant, and to the west the Meuse, which forms the border with Belgium.

 Sittard 
Sittard (Limburgs: Zitterd) is a city in Dutch Limburg, in the transition area between Central Limburg and the South Limburg hills. It is one of the oldest places in the Netherlands and the second oldest city (with city rights) in Limburg. 
Since 2001, Sittard has formed the municipality of Sittard-Geleen, together with the south-western bordering town of Geleen in the former Western Mining Area and a number of smaller towns, including Born. As a result of this merger, the municipality of Sittard-Geleen has become the third largest town in the province in terms of population (approx. 92,661). 
The original hinterland of Sittard forms the historic Land of Zwentibold around the Graetheide. 
Sittard lies exactly wedged between two national borders in the narrowest part of the province of Limburg, also the narrowest part of the Netherlands. To the east and northeast it borders Germany, near the municipality of Selfkant, and to the west the Meuse, which forms the border with Belgium.

The area has undergone significant transformation, with widespread demolition, new construction, renovation, and diversification, marking a remarkable urban renewal effort in Amsterdam Zuidoost.

 Complex and Surroundings 
This modern apartment complex (opened in the summer of 2020) sits at the crossroad of the monumental city streets Mathenesserlaan and Heemraadssingel, the latter one being known for its famous canal and green walking area.  The building itself has been entirely transformed, from a school building into a residential complex, of which only the structural beams and columns of the old building remained partly visible from the inside.   
 The surrounding neighbourhood has undergone major developments, while most of the houses and buildings in the area were built at the beginning of the previous century, more and more hip and alternative spots have opened lately. The apartment complex is perfectly located in the western part of the city centre, while it remained a quiet location it is still in the immediate vicinity of active and pleasant street life. There are various trendy shops, cafes and restaurants in the surrounding streets, like the Nieuwe Binnenweg, 2e Middellandstraat and Vierambachtsstraat.

Already interested in renting an apartment? Check if you are eligible and sign up to rent! 
 OUR COMMUNITY 
We're on a mission to reintroduce the element of community in urban apartment living. The ecosystem we create, helps you interact with your fellow residents while protecting your personal space. From cozy get-to-gethers to big events with your neighbors; we believe that life is infinitely more joyful when we're truly connected and never need to feel alone. 
The building has an atrium where you can work and enjoy a snack from the vending machines. Next to the atrium is the communal living room, which invites you to relax, watch a movie or play a game with your fellow residents. 
Both areas are designed to encourage interaction so you can connect with your neighbours. Both spaces are currently undergoing an 'upgrade'. They are being completely repainted and fitted with new furniture, so that these spaces can be even better used by the community and you too can really feel at home there. 
 WHAT WILL THE RENT OF AN APARTMENT COST ME? 
The basic rent is EUR 785 per month. 
In addition, you pay a service charge of EUR 176  per month. These costs are charged for the services offered, such as the caretakers (Tenant Ambassadors), cleaning, security, flooring, sunblind but also for internet and heating in your apartment. 
Service costs are an advance payment. Every year, you will receive an overview of the actual costs incurred. If applicable, the costs will be settled. 
You enter into a rent contract for one year. After that, the contract can be terminated monthly. 
There is a possibility to apply for rent allowance. Whether you are eligible for a rent allowance is of course entirely dependent on your income, you can calculate this on the website of the Dutch tax authorities.

You are eligible to rent an apartment if you meet all these conditions:

 I am looking for a living environment with a community of like-minded people 
 
 
 I earn a gross salary of EUR 3140 per month

WesterparkWest 
In WesterparkWest, you live with all the comforts and facilities of the city, in the greenery of an urban square with everything you need. A good cup of coffee on the terrace, running routes through the park, in the middle of urban life with all the space and comfort. 
The old office area serves as the raw material for a new, modern residential area. From closed to open. From grey and gloomy to green and relaxed. From workplace to a relaxed residential, working and living environment. 
 One prime location, seven residential buildings 
WesterparkWest offers a wide range of high-quality rental housing spread across seven unique residential buildings: Salt, Pepper, Blend and the four Basil buildings (North, East, South and West). Together, these buildings offer 552 flats, each with its own character and appeal. Whether you are young, old, single or living together, here you will find a home that suits you. The homes range from 1-, 2-, 3- and even 4-room flats and are designed with the modern resident in mind. 
A significant proportion of the flats in Basil (95 of the 250 homes) are available for middle-income earners, according to the guidelines of the Amsterdam municipality. These homes are subject to a maximum income limit of €75,362 (price level 2024). In addition, a number of free sector flats offer the option of being shared by two house-sharing tenants. 
 Sustainable and comfortable living 
All buildings in WesterparkWest combine comfort with sustainability. The flats are connected to a WKO system, which provides regulated heating in winter and cooling in summer. They have excellent ventilation and have at least energy label A, with some homes even achieving A++ or A+++. Solar panels on the roofs provide energy for general facilities, making the buildings contribute to a more sustainable future. 
 Unique living comfort 
Each flat offers fantastic views and a carefree living experience. Smart layouts, modern amenities and a peaceful living environment make WesterparkWest a place where everyone feels at home in the heart of Amsterdam. 
 In the green 
Westerpark is literally at your feet. Westerpark West is built and designed as a very high-quality place to live, work and recreate. Picnicking with your friends, playing football with the children, running laps with your neighbours or quietly enjoying the view from your own terrace: it's all possible here. We try to make 'time' here into Quality Time in every way possible. We do this with good facilities for the entire neighbourhood (think catering establishments, day nurseries) and smart, comfortable buildings (use of sustainable installations and state-of-the-art technology). In addition, we examine whether and how we can provide a possible programme of shared and personal services, such as cleaning and concierge services.

Welcome to Domus Houthaven 
Views of the city centre on one side and Amsterdam's harbours on the other. Domus Houthaven is located in the middle of the new sustainable city district, right next to the centre of Amsterdam. With 235 rental flats and various communal areas and services, everything here is geared towards modern city living. Properties are regularly available. 
 A smart home 
Domus Houthaven features a diversity of flats. Ranging from 40 sqm to 60 sqm. All homes come with solid PVC flooring, curtains and the 'smart living core' with kitchen, bathroom, cupboards, and bed. So ready to move into. 
 With many extras 
Living at Domus is living with many extra amenities. In the living room and roof garden, you walk in to work for a while or meet others. The other facilities work on a 'pay per use' basis. So no unnecessarily high service costs, but only pay for what you actually use. 
 Bringing soul into the building 
Shared spaces and facilities play a key role in Domus Living. Christa de Buvry de Mauregnault, owner of operator TO BE AT, makes sure everything is arranged and runs smoothly at the venue. 'The uniqueness of Domus lies in the combination of a smart, compact home with the possibility of extra living space in the shared living room, cooking studio and garden. This offers residents optimal living pleasure and convenience at the lowest possible ecological footprint. It is great to see that everyone uses those shared extra spaces exactly as they are intended. That goes very organically. As TO BE AT, we are there for the residents, to bring soul to this fantastic building. With hospitality, services and technology. Facility manager Marco is there every day to answer questions and pick up jobs. And community manager Rajeb himself lives in the building. He will help and inspire fellow residents to organise activities. Tenant satisfaction is already high: Domus scores a 9.3. We are proud of that and want to maintain it!' 
 Domus app 
Tomorrow's housing solutions go beyond buildings. As a service brand, we are constantly improving the daily lives of residents and our environment.

The centre of Amsterdam is only 15 minutes away by bike from the apartment. At a short distance from the building are several bus, tram and metro stops via which you can be door-to-door at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport in half an hour, as well as Amsterdam Central Station. By car, you can reach the A10 motorway within minutes.

 OUR COMMUNITY 
We're on a mission to reintroduce the element of community in urban apartment living. The ecosystem we create, helps you interact with your fellow residents while protecting your personal space. From cozy get-to-gethers to big events with your neighbors; we believe that life is infinitely more joyful when we're truly connected and never need to feel alone. 
The building has an atrium where you can work and enjoy a snack from the vending machines. Next to the atrium is the communal living room, which invites you to relax, watch a movie or play a game with your fellow residents. 
Both areas are designed to encourage interaction so you can connect with your neighbours. Both spaces are currently undergoing an 'upgrade'. They are being completely repainted and fitted with new furniture, so that these spaces can be even better used by the community and you too can really feel at home there. 
 WHAT WILL THE RENT OF AN APARTMENT COST ME? 
The basic rent is EUR 785 per month. 
In addition, you pay a service charge of EUR 176  per month. These costs are charged for the services offered, such as the caretakers (Tenant Ambassadors), cleaning, security, flooring, sunblind but also for internet and heating in your apartment. 
Service costs are an advance payment. Every year, you will receive an overview of the actual costs incurred. If applicable, the costs will be settled. 
You enter into a rent contract for one year. After that, the contract can be terminated monthly. 
There is a possibility to apply for rent allowance. Whether you are eligible for a rent allowance is of course entirely dependent on your income, you can calculate this on the website of the Dutch tax authorities. 
 AM I ELIGIBLE TO RENT AN APARTMENT? 
You are eligible to rent an apartment if you meet all these conditions: 
 
 
 I am a young professional 
 
 
 I am looking for a living environment with a community of like-minded people 
 
 
 I earn a gross salary of EUR 3140 per month 
 
 
 I want to rent for at least one year 
 
 
 PLEASE NOTE: because the basic rent is social rent, a housing permit is necessary for every tenant. Your annual income must therefore not be too high, among other things (limit: gross annual income €55,629.)

 About the project 
Welcome to Domus Houthaven 
Views of the city centre on one side and Amsterdam's harbours on the other. Domus Houthaven is located in the middle of the new sustainable city district, right next to the centre of Amsterdam. With 235 rental flats and various communal areas and services, everything here is geared towards modern city living. Properties are regularly available. 
 A smart home 
Domus Houthaven features a diversity of flats. Ranging from 40 sqm to 60 sqm. All homes come with solid PVC flooring, curtains and the 'smart living core' with kitchen, bathroom, cupboards, and bed. So ready to move into. 
 With many extras 
Living at Domus is living with many extra amenities. In the living room and roof garden, you walk in to work for a while or meet others. The other facilities work on a 'pay per use' basis. So no unnecessarily high service costs, but only pay for what you actually use. 
 Bringing soul into the building 
Shared spaces and facilities play a key role in Domus Living. Christa de Buvry de Mauregnault, owner of operator TO BE AT, makes sure everything is arranged and runs smoothly at the venue. 'The uniqueness of Domus lies in the combination of a smart, compact home with the possibility of extra living space in the shared living room, cooking studio and garden. This offers residents optimal living pleasure and convenience at the lowest possible ecological footprint. It is great to see that everyone uses those shared extra spaces exactly as they are intended. That goes very organically. As TO BE AT, we are there for the residents, to bring soul to this fantastic building. With hospitality, services and technology. Facility manager Marco is there every day to answer questions and pick up jobs. And community manager Rajeb himself lives in the building. He will help and inspire fellow residents to organise activities. Tenant satisfaction is already high: Domus scores a 9.3. We are proud of that and want to maintain it!'

Renting a studio in Amsterdam Zuidoost? 
At 801 Elizabeth Cady Stantonplein, you will find this beautiful Young Professional building, completed in 2019. The building is 10 floors high and has around 500 studios specially designed for working young people aged between 18 and 36. The building is sustainable, green and natural gas-free. In this way, the landlord contributes to a green planet. 
 The location 
Amsterdam-Zuidoost is close to various parks such as the Nelson Mandela Park (a 5-minute walk). There is also a nice shopping centre at 1-minute walking distance: Amsterdamse Poort. Amsterdam-Zuidoost is easily accessible by public transport. Both train station and metro station Amsterdam Bijlmer Arena are only a 10-minute walk away. There are also many bus connections, making it easy to reach small nearby towns as well. 
 Our service 
You enter the building with a badge system. At the entrance, you can choose to take the lift to your studio or take the stairs to the atrium. In the spacious atrium, you can meet other residents or find a quiet place to work. Next to the atrium is the communal living room, here too you can meet fellow residents or find some relaxation!

 I am a young professional 
 I am looking for a living environment with a community of like-minded people 
 I earn a gross salary of 2.820 EUR per month

 OUR COMMUNITY 
We're on a mission to reintroduce the element of community in urban apartment living. The ecosystem we create, helps you interact with your fellow residents while protecting your personal space. From cozy get-to-gethers to big events with your neighbors; we believe that life is infinitely more joyful when we're truly connected and never need to feel alone. 
The building has an atrium where you can work and enjoy a snack from the vending machines. Next to the atrium is the communal living room, which invites you to relax, watch a movie or play a game with your fellow residents. 
Both areas are designed to encourage interaction so you can connect with your neighbours. Both spaces are currently undergoing an 'upgrade'. They are being completely repainted and fitted with new furniture, so that these spaces can be even better used by the community and you too can really feel at home there. 
 WHAT WILL THE RENT OF AN APARTMENT COST ME? 
The basic rent is EUR 785 per month. 
In addition, you pay a service charge of EUR 176  per month. These costs are charged for the services offered, such as the caretakers (Tenant Ambassadors), cleaning, security, flooring, sunblind but also for internet and heating in your apartment. 
Service costs are an advance payment. Every year, you will receive an overview of the actual costs incurred. If applicable, the costs will be settled. 
You enter into a rent contract for one year. After that, the contract can be terminated monthly. 
There is a possibility to apply for rent allowance. Whether you are eligible for a rent allowance is of course entirely dependent on your income, you can calculate this on the website of the Dutch tax authorities.

It is great to see that everyone uses those shared extra spaces exactly as they are intended. That goes very organically. As TO BE AT, we are there for the residents, to bring soul to this fantastic building. With hospitality, services and technology. Facility manager Marco is there every day to answer questions and pick up jobs. And community manager Rajeb himself lives in the building.

 OUR COMMUNITY 
We're on a mission to reintroduce the element of community in urban apartment living. The ecosystem we create, helps you interact with your fellow residents while protecting your personal space. From cozy get-to-gethers to big events with your neighbors; we believe that life is infinitely more joyful when we're truly connected and never need to feel alone. 
The building has an atrium where you can work and enjoy a snack from the vending machines. Next to the atrium is the communal living room, which invites you to relax, watch a movie or play a game with your fellow residents. 
Both areas are designed to encourage interaction so you can connect with your neighbours. Both spaces are currently undergoing an 'upgrade'. They are being completely repainted and fitted with new furniture, so that these spaces can be even better used by the community and you too can really feel at home there. 
 WHAT WILL THE RENT OF AN APARTMENT COST ME? 
The basic rent is EUR 785 per month. 
In addition, you pay a service charge of EUR 176  per month. These costs are charged for the services offered, such as the caretakers (Tenant Ambassadors), cleaning, security, flooring, sunblind but also for internet and heating in your apartment. 
Service costs are an advance payment. Every year, you will receive an overview of the actual costs incurred. If applicable, the costs will be settled. 
You enter into a rent contract for one year. After that, the contract can be terminated monthly. 
There is a possibility to apply for rent allowance. Whether you are eligible for a rent allowance is of course entirely dependent on your income, you can calculate this on the website of the Dutch tax authorities.

The homes range from 1-, 2-, 3- and even 4-room flats and are designed with the modern resident in mind. 
A significant proportion of the flats in Basil (95 of the 250 homes) are available for middle-income earners, according to the guidelines of the Amsterdam municipality. These homes are subject to a maximum income limit of €75,362 (price level 2024). In addition, a number of free sector flats offer the option of being shared by two house-sharing tenants. 
 Sustainable and comfortable living 
All buildings in WesterparkWest combine comfort with sustainability. The flats are connected to a WKO system, which provides regulated heating in winter and cooling in summer. They have excellent ventilation and have at least energy label A, with some homes even achieving A++ or A+++. Solar panels on the roofs provide energy for general facilities, making the buildings contribute to a more sustainable future. 
 Unique living comfort 
Each flat offers fantastic views and a carefree living experience. Smart layouts, modern amenities and a peaceful living environment make WesterparkWest a place where everyone feels at home in the heart of Amsterdam.

We do this with good facilities for the entire neighbourhood (think catering establishments, day nurseries) and smart, comfortable buildings (use of sustainable installations and state-of-the-art technology).

Welcome to Domus Houthaven 
Views of the city centre on one side and Amsterdam's harbours on the other. Domus Houthaven is located in the middle of the new sustainable city district, right next to the centre of Amsterdam. With 235 rental flats and various communal areas and services, everything here is geared towards modern city living. Properties are regularly available.

Domus Houthaven features a diversity of flats. Ranging from 40 sqm to 60 sqm. All homes come with solid PVC flooring, curtains and the 'smart living core' with kitchen, bathroom, cupboards, and bed. So ready to move into. 
 With many extras 
Living at Domus is living with many extra amenities. In the living room and roof garden, you walk in to work for a while or meet others. The other facilities work on a 'pay per use' basis. So no unnecessarily high service costs, but only pay for what you actually use. 
 Bringing soul into the building 
Shared spaces and facilities play a key role in Domus Living. Christa de Buvry de Mauregnault, owner of operator TO BE AT, makes sure everything is arranged and runs smoothly at the venue. 'The uniqueness of Domus lies in the combination of a smart, compact home with the possibility of extra living space in the shared living room, cooking studio and garden. This offers residents optimal living pleasure and convenience at the lowest possible ecological footprint. It is great to see that everyone uses those shared extra spaces exactly as they are intended. That goes very organically. As TO BE AT, we are there for the residents, to bring soul to this fantastic building. With hospitality, services and technology. Facility manager Marco is there every day to answer questions and pick up jobs. And community manager Rajeb himself lives in the building. He will help and inspire fellow residents to organise activities. Tenant satisfaction is already high: Domus scores a 9.3. We are proud of that and want to maintain it!'

 Proud to offer this high class apartment in the De Vijzel-building in the new developed area of Oostenburg, right along the waterfront.

The two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment, used as a pied-à-terre since completion, is still in excellent condition.   
 BUILDING 
With its cast-iron architecture, the ""De VIJZEL"" complex directly references the industrial SoHo district in New York, fitting in with Oostenburg's industrial history. From De Vijzel, which stands five stories high, you have a wide view over the Wittenburgervaart and the inner city of Amsterdam. The focus of De Vijzel is outward. The front faces VOC-Kade, while the back overlooks a public courtyard. The building is an example of circular construction, with concrete in the load-bearing structure made from crushed, recycled materials, and the bricks are fully circular.

 AREA 
Oostenburg Island has transformed into an exciting, waterfront neighborhood with a rich mix of buildings and functions. It is very popular with café-restaurants like Roest and Rosa & Rita. This part of the city center, near the Czaar Peterstraat, has been transformed into a typical Amsterdam city district: contrasting, lively, and robust. Close to the center, by the water, and with all amenities on the island. There is plenty of room for unique shops, cozy coffee spots, inspiring co working spaces, original restaurants, and motivating sports facilities. The green roofs on the various buildings are also a conscious choice. 
 Oostenburg Island is car-free. Cyclists and pedestrians have all the space! There are plenty of recreational opportunities, including the nearby Funenpark. 
 ACCESSIBILITY AND PARKING: 
Oostenburg is easy to reach. The Piet Hein tunnel provides quick access to the A-10 ring road. Central Station is also within close reach. In the nearby Czaar Peterstraat, you’ll find tram 7, which can take you to both the KNSM island and the Rijksmuseum, or even further to Sloterpark in Nieuw-West. Oostenburg's design is consciously car-free, meaning parking is available but limited, for example, in the garage operated by Q-Park or in the Stadswerf parking garage. Cyclists are particularly well-served, thanks in part to the indoor bicycle storage you can use as a resident.

 LOCATION 
Scheveningen is a lively neighbourhood with dunes, beaches and the sea within walking distance. You can enjoy these every day if you live in Scheveningen. Go for a walk on the beach at sunset, hit the waves for a solid surfing session, or relax on a towel with a good book. If you’re looking for something a little different from the dunes, the beach and the sea, Scheveningen also borders an area with a number of beautiful parks, including the Scheveningse Bosjes, Westbroekpark and Hubertuspark. The district consists of the Dorp (Village), Haven (Harbor) and Bad (Bath) areas, each with its own character. 
With its characteristic Oude Kerk and Keizerstraat, the ‘Dorp’ is the meeting point for many residents. Densely clustered courts with narrow streets give some areas an authentic fishing village atmosphere. Keizerstraat is the oldest and most historic shopping street in Scheveningen. There are many small shops and restaurants, but also a large supermarket. 
Scheveningen ‘Haven’ has three different characters. The first inner harbor is the fishing port where fresh fish comes in daily and the rugged character is visible. There are nice cafés and restaurants around the second harbor, and sailing boats are moored there. There are also new apartment buildings with beautiful views. In the future there will be different kinds of dwellings appearing around the third harbor in a unique new development area. 
‘Bad’ boasts the historic Kurhaus, a cinema and the Circus Theater. These, together with the beautiful revamped promenade and the many beach pavilions, make this the tourism centre of Scheveningen. However, the residents of the district often also seek out the friendly hustle and bustle for a night out or just a stroll. (******)

 SURROUNDINGS 
Scheveningen is a lively neighbourhood with dunes, beaches and the sea within walking distance. You can enjoy these every day if you live in Scheveningen. Go for a walk on the beach at sunset, hit the waves for a solid surfing session, or relax on a towel with a good book. If you’re looking for something a little different from the dunes, the beach and the sea, Scheveningen also borders an area with a number of beautiful parks, including the Scheveningse Bosjes, Westbroekpark and Hubertuspark. The district consists of the Dorp (Village), Haven (Harbour) and Bad (Bath) areas, each with its own character. 
With its characteristic Oude Kerk and Keijzerstraat, the ‘Dorp’ is the meeting point for many residents. Densely clustered courts with narrow streets give some areas an authentic fishing village atmosphere. Keizerstraat is the oldest and most historic shopping street in Scheveningen. There are many small shops and eateries, but also a large supermarket. 
Scheveningen ‘Haven’ has three different characters. The first inner harbour is the fishing port where fresh fish comes in every day and the rugged character is visible. There are nice cafés and restaurants around the second harbour, and sailing boats are moored there. There are also new apartment buildings with beautiful views. In the future there will be different kinds of dwellings appearing around the third harbour in a unique new development area. 
‘Bad’ boasts the historic Kurhaus, a cinema and the Circus Theater. These, together with the beautiful revamped promenade and the many beach pavilions, make this the tourism centre of Scheveningen. However, the residents of the district often also seek out the friendly hustle and bustle for a night out or just a stroll.  
 PUBLIC TRANSPORT 
There are several public transport options in and around Scheveningen, with transport to the center of The Hague, Holland Spoor and Central Station:

 Entrance The apartment's entrance exudes a warm and chic hotel-like atmosphere. The spacious hallway provides access to the toilet, living room, the two bedrooms, and the bathroom. The large windows in the living room allow natural light to flood in, contributing to the spacious and open feel of the entrance. The glass door enhances this effect, allowing light to flow freely through the various spaces. The seamless cast floor, which extends from the hallway into the kitchen, utility room, and one of the two bedrooms, gives a sleek and modern look and is very low-maintenance. The apartment is equipped with district heating, with the utility closet also located in the apartment's entrance. 
 Toilet The toilet is fully tiled and features a sleek plastered ceiling with a built-in reservoir. An accent wall behind the toilet adds a rustic and luxurious touch to the space. Carefully chosen details, such as the stylish stone sink, make this toilet a refined space.

 Living Room The spacious living room is bathed in natural light thanks to the large and high windows, which not only create a bright and airy atmosphere but also offer a view of the very quiet courtyard and one of Eindhoven's most iconic buildings, De Witte Dame. An interesting level difference in the living room – with the living area slightly lower than the rest – creates a unique, playful layout and natural separation of the different living spaces. The dark wooden herringbone floor enhances the modern look of the living room and contributes to the stylish ambiance. The living room is equipped with a smart TV, a large and luxurious upholstered corner sofa which was recently purchased and is completely unused. Additionally, the large cabinet offers extra storage space through compartments, cupboards, and drawers.

The master bedroom is equipped with a smart TV including Chromecast with Google TV, carpet, and a large and luxurious wardrobe with multiple storage options. This bedroom offers more than enough space for a large double bed. The second bedroom has a cast floor, is flexible in its layout, and can serve as a workspace or guest room, depending on your personal preferences. 
 Bathroom The bathroom exudes a unique combination of luxury and tranquility. The highlight is the very spacious walk-in shower, equipped with a luxurious rain shower seamlessly integrated into the ceiling and a subtle, wall-mounted thermostat. These modern details create a sleek and minimalist design while simultaneously offering a refreshing shower experience. The rustic charm of the bathroom is enhanced by a carefully chosen accent wall and stone sinks, which evoke a sense of calm and serenity. The double vanity unit not only offers plenty of storage space but is also topped with an elegant marble countertop, giving the space a timeless appearance. A matte black designer radiator completes the look, adding both functionality and style to this thoughtfully designed bathroom.

 Location: 
Sint Nicolaasstraat is one of the oldest streets in Amsterdam. A place where one can rightly speak of a ""neighborhood feeling"", where everyone knows each other in the middle of the vibrant heart of the city. A street with lots of greenery, in the center and yet very quiet. It is located around the corner from Dam Square and between the Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal and the Nieuwendijk; it is a special place. There are many nice bars and restaurants in the area. All necessary shops for daily shopping and non-daily shopping (Bijenkort) are also a very short distance from the house. Furthermore, the public transport connections are very good, you can reach Central Station within a five-minute walk. Various trams and the North-South line take you quickly to all corners of the city and the country. The travel time to Schilhol, for example, is 20 minutes. 
 Layout: 
Upon entering, you enter the spacious entrance that provides access to the impressive dining room with an open kitchen. This spacious kitchen has a sleek design and is fully equipped, including a cooking island with a Gaggenau stove, and other modern appliances. The long table functions as a work and meeting place during the day and is the perfect place for cozy dinners with friends in the evening. 
 The floor of robust end-grain oak and the French doors to the terrace give the apartment a warm, inviting atmosphere and an abundance of natural light. The patio garden of approximately 28 sqm is a wonderfully relaxing place in the house where you can enjoy the greenery.  
 Adjacent to the kitchen, two steps lower, is the spacious living room. This room is spacious, not only in terms of surface area but also gives a surprisingly light atmosphere due to its height of no less than 3.05 meters and the incidence of light. It's a fantastic place to relax in the evening. In addition, this entire room has underfloor heating, wonderful!  
 There is also a separate room with a toilet and pantry. The pantry can easily be converted into a shower or cupboard space.  
 Via the stairs, you reach the basement, where there is a spacious bedroom. Again equipped with underfloor heating. This room offers plenty of space and comfort and is ideal as a master bedroom. Through the walk-in closet, you enter the second room on this floor, which currently serves as a laundry room and storage room.

 Area: 
Van Eeghenstraat 29B and 31 are located in the Oud-Zuid district. It is a quiet, green and friendly neighborhood. Amsterdam Oud-Zuid is one of the most prestigious neighborhoods to live in in the city! The houses are located in the heart of the Museum Quarter. The house is located on the edge of the Vondelpark, in the immediate vicinity of the Museumplein and various luxury shopping streets (including Cornelis Schuytstraat, P.C. Hooftstraat and Van Baerlestraat). From a cultural point of view, you are also in a super location with the Concertgebouw around the corner, as well as the internationally renowned museums: the Rijksmuseum, Stedelijk Museum and Van Gogh Museum. For daily shopping you can go to the Albert Hein on the Museumplein or Marqt on the Overtoom. The houses are easily accessible by public transport (trams and buses) and by car you can easily reach the A-10 ring road, A-2, A-4 and Schiphol Airport via the various roads. 
 Project information: 
The renovation concerns two individual buildings: Van Eeghenstraat 29B and 31. A large-scale renovation has ensured that the buildings once again meet the requirements of today and at the same time retain their unique appearance. Both the exterior and the interior have been restored and where necessary renewed. New roofs, window frames and fronts have been installed, the masonry has been repaired and the floors have been reinforced. At the rear, the current balconies have been completely renovated. 
 During the renovation, a lot of attention is paid to sustainability. The floors, roofs and walls have been re-insulated. All apartments have underfloor heating and LED lighting. 
 A style of its own: 
All apartments have been given a high-quality finish and a completely individual style. The style was designed by Heyligers Architects and can best be described as 'Amsterdam chic meets Scandinavian minimalism'. A style that stands for many details, moldings and clean lines, for natural materials, minimalism and for serene tranquility. Many light shades have been used in the apartments, which are combined with dark, steel fronts. In contrast to normal, clear glass, ribbed glass has been used in the steel facade, which creates a special atmosphere. The light oak floor laid in a Hungarian point, the white panel doors, the moldings around the windows and doors and the classic skirting boards provide a luxurious look. Everything has been taken into account in the apartments. For example, they are equipped with a walk-in closet and niches that offer space for decorative cabinets. 
 Kitchen: 
The kitchen is a combination of matte light gray kitchen fronts, a thin composite sand-colored worktop with light veins through which the sink runs. A brass Quooker tap completes this ton-sur-ton kitchen and will give it its own look that seamlessly matches the atmosphere in the rest of the apartment. 
 Bathroom: 
Where light shades predominate in the apartment, darker shades are used in the bathroom. For example, the walls of the shower and sink are fitted with dark wall tiles. By alternating this with a Hungarian point and cross bond, a playful effect is created. White ceramic tiles with a light gray vein have been chosen for the other walls and the floor, which, together with the bronze taps, provide a chic look. The light-dark contrast is also reflected in the washbasin furniture: slightly ribbed wooden drawers and a black marble top. The free-standing bath, separate shower and double sink complete the picture.",Museumkwartier,Flat,A,"Present (52 m², located on the south)",For rent: Flat Van Eeghenstraat,https://www.pararius.com/apartment-for-rent/amsterdam/22c8ea71/van-eeghenstraat,,135.0,,,2,3,4,28-11-2024,,5750.0,"Downstairs apartment, Apartment",,,,For rent,2023

 Whether you want a long vacation, between 2 homes or just want to unwind. That is possible here!

So neatly styled and clean, you do not see that often. 
 This corner house is really super central in Papendrecht, but also central to several major cities. And whether you prefer to go by car or public transport, both are a great option from here. After a long day at work you don't want to have to look for a parking spot, with your own private parking space you don't have to. 
 The house is within walking distance of the shopping street and numerous eateries, cafes and restaurants. The train station is also within walking and cycling distance. 
 The property is truly a hidden jewel, you easily drive past it without knowing what you actually missed. And that's just the beginning. Modern and centrally located with a generous roof terrace. Located in a quiet neighborhood with shopping around the corner. This cozy home offers the best of both worlds: quiet surroundings and all amenities at your fingertips.

The modern bathroom is fully tiled and equipped with a spacious shower with thermostatic faucet and a washbasin and mirror.

There is also a storage area for garden cushions and space for a small fridge. There is always a place where you can sit in the sun. If it shines of course :)
