WesterparkWest 
In WesterparkWest, you live with all the comforts and facilities of the city, in the greenery of an urban square with everything you need. A good cup of coffee on the terrace, running routes through the park, in the middle of urban life with all the space and comfort. 
The old office area serves as the raw material for a new, modern residential area. From closed to open. From grey and gloomy to green and relaxed. From workplace to a relaxed residential, working and living environment. 
 One prime location, seven residential buildings 
WesterparkWest offers a wide range of high-quality rental housing spread across seven unique residential buildings: Salt, Pepper, Blend and the four Basil buildings (North, East, South and West). Together, these buildings offer 552 flats, each with its own character and appeal. Whether you are young, old, single or living together, here you will find a home that suits you. The homes range from 1-, 2-, 3- and even 4-room flats and are designed with the modern resident in mind. 
A significant proportion of the flats in Basil (95 of the 250 homes) are available for middle-income earners, according to the guidelines of the Amsterdam municipality. These homes are subject to a maximum income limit of €75,362 (price level 2024). In addition, a number of free sector flats offer the option of being shared by two house-sharing tenants. 
 Sustainable and comfortable living 
All buildings in WesterparkWest combine comfort with sustainability. The flats are connected to a WKO system, which provides regulated heating in winter and cooling in summer. They have excellent ventilation and have at least energy label A, with some homes even achieving A++ or A+++. Solar panels on the roofs provide energy for general facilities, making the buildings contribute to a more sustainable future. 
 Unique living comfort 
Each flat offers fantastic views and a carefree living experience. Smart layouts, modern amenities and a peaceful living environment make WesterparkWest a place where everyone feels at home in the heart of Amsterdam. 
 In the green 
Westerpark is literally at your feet. Westerpark West is built and designed as a very high-quality place to live, work and recreate. Picnicking with your friends, playing football with the children, running laps with your neighbours or quietly enjoying the view from your own terrace: it's all possible here. We try to make 'time' here into Quality Time in every way possible. We do this with good facilities for the entire neighbourhood (think catering establishments, day nurseries) and smart, comfortable buildings (use of sustainable installations and state-of-the-art technology). In addition, we examine whether and how we can provide a possible programme of shared and personal services, such as cleaning and concierge services.

The building has an atrium where you can work and enjoy a snack from the vending machines. Next to the atrium is the communal living room, which invites you to relax, watch a movie or play a game with your fellow residents. 
Both areas are designed to encourage interaction so you can connect with your neighbours. Both spaces are currently undergoing an 'upgrade'. They are being completely repainted and fitted with new furniture, so that these spaces can be even better used by the community and you too can really feel at home there.

LOCATION 
The building is located in the Nieuw-West district, just outside the Amsterdam ring road. Supermarkets and nice cosy shops and restaurants are in the immediate vicinity. In addition, there is plenty of greenery within walking distance; on one side of the building the Sloterplas with surrounding park and on the other side the Rembrandtpark with its beautiful ponds, lawns and playgrounds and which also offers a 'green' cycling route to the city centre. The centre of Amsterdam is only 15 minutes away by bike from the apartment. At a short distance from the building are several bus, tram and metro stops via which you can be door-to-door at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport in half an hour, as well as Amsterdam Central Station. By car, you can reach the A10 motorway within minutes. 
 OUR SERVICES 
The Tenant Ambassadors from To Be At are at your service every day to provide you with an optimal living experience. Whether it's carrying out a repair request in your home, directing the cleaning when an accident has happened or just having a chat, they are happy to do so. You speak to them in the atrium, create a ticket in our own resident app or send a chat message - getting in touch has never been easier! 
With our services, we make your life easier and more fun! For example, we offer various services such as the Miele Laundry Boutique, a shared laundry facility, MyPup lockers, for receiving and sending packages in a safe and sustainable way, and you can book our cleaning service for cleaning your studio. 
Already interested in renting an apartment? Check if you are eligible and sign up to rent! 
 OUR COMMUNITY 
We're on a mission to reintroduce the element of community in urban apartment living. The ecosystem we create, helps you interact with your fellow residents while protecting your personal space. From cozy get-to-gethers to big events with your neighbors; we believe that life is infinitely more joyful when we're truly connected and never need to feel alone. 
The building has an atrium where you can work and enjoy a snack from the vending machines. Next to the atrium is the communal living room, which invites you to relax, watch a movie or play a game with your fellow residents. 
Both areas are designed to encourage interaction so you can connect with your neighbours. Both spaces are currently undergoing an 'upgrade'. They are being completely repainted and fitted with new furniture, so that these spaces can be even better used by the community and you too can really feel at home there. 
 WHAT WILL THE RENT OF AN APARTMENT COST ME? 
The basic rent is EUR 785 per month. 
In addition, you pay a service charge of EUR 176  per month. These costs are charged for the services offered, such as the caretakers (Tenant Ambassadors), cleaning, security, flooring, sunblind but also for internet and heating in your apartment. 
Service costs are an advance payment. Every year, you will receive an overview of the actual costs incurred. If applicable, the costs will be settled. 
You enter into a rent contract for one year. After that, the contract can be terminated monthly. 
There is a possibility to apply for rent allowance. Whether you are eligible for a rent allowance is of course entirely dependent on your income, you can calculate this on the website of the Dutch tax authorities. 
 AM I ELIGIBLE TO RENT AN APARTMENT? 
You are eligible to rent an apartment if you meet all these conditions: 
 
 
 I am a young professional 
 
 
 I am looking for a living environment with a community of like-minded people 
 
 
 I earn a gross salary of EUR 3140 per month

Welcome to Domus Houthaven 
Views of the city centre on one side and Amsterdam's harbours on the other. Domus Houthaven is located in the middle of the new sustainable city district, right next to the centre of Amsterdam. With 235 rental flats and various communal areas and services, everything here is geared towards modern city living. Properties are regularly available. 
 A smart home 
Domus Houthaven features a diversity of flats. Ranging from 40 sqm to 60 sqm. All homes come with solid PVC flooring, curtains and the 'smart living core' with kitchen, bathroom, cupboards, and bed. So ready to move into. 
 With many extras 
Living at Domus is living with many extra amenities. In the living room and roof garden, you walk in to work for a while or meet others. The other facilities work on a 'pay per use' basis. So no unnecessarily high service costs, but only pay for what you actually use. 
 Bringing soul into the building 
Shared spaces and facilities play a key role in Domus Living. Christa de Buvry de Mauregnault, owner of operator TO BE AT, makes sure everything is arranged and runs smoothly at the venue. 'The uniqueness of Domus lies in the combination of a smart, compact home with the possibility of extra living space in the shared living room, cooking studio and garden. This offers residents optimal living pleasure and convenience at the lowest possible ecological footprint. It is great to see that everyone uses those shared extra spaces exactly as they are intended. That goes very organically. As TO BE AT, we are there for the residents, to bring soul to this fantastic building. With hospitality, services and technology. Facility manager Marco is there every day to answer questions and pick up jobs. And community manager Rajeb himself lives in the building. He will help and inspire fellow residents to organise activities. Tenant satisfaction is already high: Domus scores a 9.3. We are proud of that and want to maintain it!'

Tomorrow's housing solutions go beyond buildings. As a service brand, we are constantly improving the daily lives of residents and our environment.

LOCATION 
The building is located in the Nieuw-West district, just outside the Amsterdam ring road. Supermarkets and nice cosy shops and restaurants are in the immediate vicinity. In addition, there is plenty of greenery within walking distance; on one side of the building the Sloterplas with surrounding park and on the other side the Rembrandtpark with its beautiful ponds, lawns and playgrounds and which also offers a 'green' cycling route to the city centre. The centre of Amsterdam is only 15 minutes away by bike from the apartment. At a short distance from the building are several bus, tram and metro stops via which you can be door-to-door at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport in half an hour, as well as Amsterdam Central Station. By car, you can reach the A10 motorway within minutes. 
 OUR SERVICES 
The Tenant Ambassadors from To Be At are at your service every day to provide you with an optimal living experience. Whether it's carrying out a repair request in your home, directing the cleaning when an accident has happened or just having a chat, they are happy to do so. You speak to them in the atrium, create a ticket in our own resident app or send a chat message - getting in touch has never been easier! 
With our services, we make your life easier and more fun! For example, we offer various services such as the Miele Laundry Boutique, a shared laundry facility, MyPup lockers, for receiving and sending packages in a safe and sustainable way, and you can book our cleaning service for cleaning your studio. 
Already interested in renting an apartment? Check if you are eligible and sign up to rent! 
 OUR COMMUNITY 
We're on a mission to reintroduce the element of community in urban apartment living. The ecosystem we create, helps you interact with your fellow residents while protecting your personal space. From cozy get-to-gethers to big events with your neighbors; we believe that life is infinitely more joyful when we're truly connected and never need to feel alone. 
The building has an atrium where you can work and enjoy a snack from the vending machines. Next to the atrium is the communal living room, which invites you to relax, watch a movie or play a game with your fellow residents. 
Both areas are designed to encourage interaction so you can connect with your neighbours. Both spaces are currently undergoing an 'upgrade'. They are being completely repainted and fitted with new furniture, so that these spaces can be even better used by the community and you too can really feel at home there. 
 WHAT WILL THE RENT OF AN APARTMENT COST ME? 
The basic rent is EUR 785 per month. 
In addition, you pay a service charge of EUR 176  per month. These costs are charged for the services offered, such as the caretakers (Tenant Ambassadors), cleaning, security, flooring, sunblind but also for internet and heating in your apartment. 
Service costs are an advance payment. Every year, you will receive an overview of the actual costs incurred. If applicable, the costs will be settled. 
You enter into a rent contract for one year. After that, the contract can be terminated monthly. 
There is a possibility to apply for rent allowance. Whether you are eligible for a rent allowance is of course entirely dependent on your income, you can calculate this on the website of the Dutch tax authorities. 
 AM I ELIGIBLE TO RENT AN APARTMENT? 
You are eligible to rent an apartment if you meet all these conditions: 
 
 
 I am a young professional 
 
 
 I am looking for a living environment with a community of like-minded people 
 
 
 I earn a gross salary of EUR 3140 per month

 Proud to offer this high class apartment in the De Vijzel-building in the new developed area of Oostenburg, right along the waterfront. Its location on the 4th floor ensures beautiful views over the marina and the Wittenburg district. The two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment, used as a pied-à-terre since completion, is still in excellent condition.   
 BUILDING 
With its cast-iron architecture, the ""De VIJZEL"" complex directly references the industrial SoHo district in New York, fitting in with Oostenburg's industrial history. From De Vijzel, which stands five stories high, you have a wide view over the Wittenburgervaart and the inner city of Amsterdam. The focus of De Vijzel is outward. The front faces VOC-Kade, while the back overlooks a public courtyard. The building is an example of circular construction, with concrete in the load-bearing structure made from crushed, recycled materials, and the bricks are fully circular.

 AREA 
Oostenburg Island has transformed into an exciting, waterfront neighborhood with a rich mix of buildings and functions. It is very popular with café-restaurants like Roest and Rosa & Rita. This part of the city center, near the Czaar Peterstraat, has been transformed into a typical Amsterdam city district: contrasting, lively, and robust. Close to the center, by the water, and with all amenities on the island. There is plenty of room for unique shops, cozy coffee spots, inspiring co working spaces, original restaurants, and motivating sports facilities. The green roofs on the various buildings are also a conscious choice. 
 Oostenburg Island is car-free. Cyclists and pedestrians have all the space! There are plenty of recreational opportunities, including the nearby Funenpark. 
 ACCESSIBILITY AND PARKING: 
Oostenburg is easy to reach. The Piet Hein tunnel provides quick access to the A-10 ring road. Central Station is also within close reach. In the nearby Czaar Peterstraat, you’ll find tram 7, which can take you to both the KNSM island and the Rijksmuseum, or even further to Sloterpark in Nieuw-West. Oostenburg's design is consciously car-free, meaning parking is available but limited, for example, in the garage operated by Q-Park or in the Stadswerf parking garage. Cyclists are particularly well-served, thanks in part to the indoor bicycle storage you can use as a resident.

This property is the option for families looking for a spacious home near the city. From the hall you reach the large living and dining area, well-lit and spacious thanks to the open-plan kitchen. From the living room you have access to a balcony. Large enough for a nice sitting area, so that you can enjoy the view over the city with a drink. Space prevails in the whole flat, because the two bedrooms even have their own hall. These bedrooms have large French windows and are almost the same size. This allows each member of the family to have his or her own space. But even without children, the second bedroom comes in handy - use it, for example, as a large work or study space.

If you’re looking for something a little different from the dunes, the beach and the sea, Scheveningen also borders an area with a number of beautiful parks, including the Scheveningse Bosjes, Westbroekpark and Hubertuspark. The district consists of the Dorp (Village), Haven (Harbor) and Bad (Bath) areas, each with its own character. 
With its characteristic Oude Kerk and Keizerstraat, the ‘Dorp’ is the meeting point for many residents. Densely clustered courts with narrow streets give some areas an authentic fishing village atmosphere. Keizerstraat is the oldest and most historic shopping street in Scheveningen. There are many small shops and restaurants, but also a large supermarket. 
Scheveningen ‘Haven’ has three different characters. The first inner harbor is the fishing port where fresh fish comes in daily and the rugged character is visible. There are nice cafés and restaurants around the second harbor, and sailing boats are moored there. There are also new apartment buildings with beautiful views. In the future there will be different kinds of dwellings appearing around the third harbor in a unique new development area. 
‘Bad’ boasts the historic Kurhaus, a cinema and the Circus Theater. These, together with the beautiful revamped promenade and the many beach pavilions, make this the tourism centre of Scheveningen. However, the residents of the district often also seek out the friendly hustle and bustle for a night out or just a stroll. (******)

 SURROUNDINGS 
Scheveningen is a lively neighbourhood with dunes, beaches and the sea within walking distance. You can enjoy these every day if you live in Scheveningen. Go for a walk on the beach at sunset, hit the waves for a solid surfing session, or relax on a towel with a good book. If you’re looking for something a little different from the dunes, the beach and the sea, Scheveningen also borders an area with a number of beautiful parks, including the Scheveningse Bosjes, Westbroekpark and Hubertuspark. The district consists of the Dorp (Village), Haven (Harbour) and Bad (Bath) areas, each with its own character. 
With its characteristic Oude Kerk and Keijzerstraat, the ‘Dorp’ is the meeting point for many residents. Densely clustered courts with narrow streets give some areas an authentic fishing village atmosphere. Keizerstraat is the oldest and most historic shopping street in Scheveningen. There are many small shops and eateries, but also a large supermarket. 
Scheveningen ‘Haven’ has three different characters. The first inner harbour is the fishing port where fresh fish comes in every day and the rugged character is visible. There are nice cafés and restaurants around the second harbour, and sailing boats are moored there. There are also new apartment buildings with beautiful views. In the future there will be different kinds of dwellings appearing around the third harbour in a unique new development area. 
‘Bad’ boasts the historic Kurhaus, a cinema and the Circus Theater. These, together with the beautiful revamped promenade and the many beach pavilions, make this the tourism centre of Scheveningen. However, the residents of the district often also seek out the friendly hustle and bustle for a night out or just a stroll.  
 PUBLIC TRANSPORT 
There are several public transport options in and around Scheveningen, with transport to the center of The Hague, Holland Spoor and Central Station:

 Kitchen Upon entering the kitchen, the sleek and modern design immediately catches the eye. The spacious island not only offers ample workspace but also a cozy bar. The marble countertop combined with the sleek and timeless kitchen design gives the kitchen a luxurious yet inviting feel. The high-quality built-in appliances, including a brand-new recently installed Quooker hot water tap, an induction cooktop with integrated ventilation, and a built-in refrigerator, make cooking a delightful experience. The kitchen is also fully equipped with tableware, a coffee machine, milk frother, and other kitchen essentials. A practical storage room with extra kitchen cabinets is equipped with a freezer, washing machine, dryer, ironing board, iron, stick vacuum cleaner, drying racks, cleaning supplies such as a bucket, mop, broom and dustpan, and additional free storage space. 
 Living Room The spacious living room is bathed in natural light thanks to the large and high windows, which not only create a bright and airy atmosphere but also offer a view of the very quiet courtyard and one of Eindhoven's most iconic buildings, De Witte Dame. An interesting level difference in the living room – with the living area slightly lower than the rest – creates a unique, playful layout and natural separation of the different living spaces. The dark wooden herringbone floor enhances the modern look of the living room and contributes to the stylish ambiance. The living room is equipped with a smart TV, a large and luxurious upholstered corner sofa which was recently purchased and is completely unused. Additionally, the large cabinet offers extra storage space through compartments, cupboards, and drawers. 
 Terrace From the living room, you have direct access to a wide balcony, where you can enjoy the fresh air in peace, overlooking the communal outdoor space and the iconic building De Witte Dame. This spacious balcony is furnished with a hanging chair, a bistro set, a lounge sofa, and a barbecue. Ideal for relaxation and perfectly set up for cozy moments. The balcony also provides direct access to the enclosed, communal, and quiet courtyard. 
 Bedrooms Both bedrooms are spacious and equipped with tilt-and-turn windows, allowing for plenty of natural light and good ventilation. The master bedroom is equipped with a smart TV including Chromecast with Google TV, carpet, and a large and luxurious wardrobe with multiple storage options. This bedroom offers more than enough space for a large double bed. The second bedroom has a cast floor, is flexible in its layout, and can serve as a workspace or guest room, depending on your personal preferences. 
 Bathroom The bathroom exudes a unique combination of luxury and tranquility. The highlight is the very spacious walk-in shower, equipped with a luxurious rain shower seamlessly integrated into the ceiling and a subtle, wall-mounted thermostat. These modern details create a sleek and minimalist design while simultaneously offering a refreshing shower experience. The rustic charm of the bathroom is enhanced by a carefully chosen accent wall and stone sinks, which evoke a sense of calm and serenity. The double vanity unit not only offers plenty of storage space but is also topped with an elegant marble countertop, giving the space a timeless appearance. A matte black designer radiator completes the look, adding both functionality and style to this thoughtfully designed bathroom. 
 Storage Room This apartment includes a handy, extra tall storage room of approximately 6 m². This storage room is equipped with shelves, providing plenty of storage capacity. Below these shelves, there is space for a bicycle, for example, offering the possibility to safely store it. This storage room is accessible via multiple entrances, both directly from outside and through the central hall. With electric doors, you can easily maneuver through all the hallways with full hands or with your bicycle.

It has a lovely open living floor with an open kitchen and, characteristic of a warehouse, French doors in the facade. Large skylights in the middle of the house provide ample daylight, and the fixed staircase leads to the second floor with a spacious landing and a very large bedroom. 
 SURROUNDINGS:

 Area: 
Van Eeghenstraat 29B and 31 are located in the Oud-Zuid district. It is a quiet, green and friendly neighborhood. Amsterdam Oud-Zuid is one of the most prestigious neighborhoods to live in in the city! The houses are located in the heart of the Museum Quarter. The house is located on the edge of the Vondelpark, in the immediate vicinity of the Museumplein and various luxury shopping streets (including Cornelis Schuytstraat, P.C. Hooftstraat and Van Baerlestraat). From a cultural point of view, you are also in a super location with the Concertgebouw around the corner, as well as the internationally renowned museums: the Rijksmuseum, Stedelijk Museum and Van Gogh Museum. For daily shopping you can go to the Albert Hein on the Museumplein or Marqt on the Overtoom. The houses are easily accessible by public transport (trams and buses) and by car you can easily reach the A-10 ring road, A-2, A-4 and Schiphol Airport via the various roads. 
 Project information: 
The renovation concerns two individual buildings: Van Eeghenstraat 29B and 31. A large-scale renovation has ensured that the buildings once again meet the requirements of today and at the same time retain their unique appearance. Both the exterior and the interior have been restored and where necessary renewed. New roofs, window frames and fronts have been installed, the masonry has been repaired and the floors have been reinforced. At the rear, the current balconies have been completely renovated. 
 During the renovation, a lot of attention is paid to sustainability. The floors, roofs and walls have been re-insulated. All apartments have underfloor heating and LED lighting. 
 A style of its own: 
All apartments have been given a high-quality finish and a completely individual style. The style was designed by Heyligers Architects and can best be described as 'Amsterdam chic meets Scandinavian minimalism'. A style that stands for many details, moldings and clean lines, for natural materials, minimalism and for serene tranquility. Many light shades have been used in the apartments, which are combined with dark, steel fronts. In contrast to normal, clear glass, ribbed glass has been used in the steel facade, which creates a special atmosphere. The light oak floor laid in a Hungarian point, the white panel doors, the moldings around the windows and doors and the classic skirting boards provide a luxurious look. Everything has been taken into account in the apartments. For example, they are equipped with a walk-in closet and niches that offer space for decorative cabinets. 
 Kitchen: 
The kitchen is a combination of matte light gray kitchen fronts, a thin composite sand-colored worktop with light veins through which the sink runs. A brass Quooker tap completes this ton-sur-ton kitchen and will give it its own look that seamlessly matches the atmosphere in the rest of the apartment. 
 Bathroom: 
Where light shades predominate in the apartment, darker shades are used in the bathroom. For example, the walls of the shower and sink are fitted with dark wall tiles. By alternating this with a Hungarian point and cross bond, a playful effect is created. White ceramic tiles with a light gray vein have been chosen for the other walls and the floor, which, together with the bronze taps, provide a chic look. The light-dark contrast is also reflected in the washbasin furniture: slightly ribbed wooden drawers and a black marble top. The free-standing bath, separate shower and double sink complete the picture.",,Flat,A,"Present (52 m², located on the south)",For rent: Flat Van Eeghenstraat in Amsterdam,https://www.pararius.com/apartment-for-rent/amsterdam/22c8ea71/van-eeghenstraat,,2,3,4,26-11-2024,,5750.0,"Downstairs apartment, Apartment",,,,For rent,2023

From the nearby train station, there are four trains per hour during rush hour to Amsterdam (12 minutes to Amstel CS), Utrecht, and Rotterdam. Abcoude is characterized by its charming historic center, nice shops, cafes with lovely terraces, and many village activities, including the famous Abcouder Festival Week, a weekly market, a wide range of sports facilities, four primary schools, and ample professional childcare options. The surrounding area is also excellent for recreation. The region around Abcoude is popular with walkers and cyclists. Beautiful cycling and walking routes run along the Angstel and Gein rivers, and in or near the Abcoudermeer or at the recreational beach, it's a great place to relax on summer days. The Vinkeveense Plassen and Ouderkerk aan de Amstel are also within cycling distance.

 Living in a completely modern renovated, historic and characteristic warehouse from the 18th century on the charming and quiet Prinseneiland? Then this apartment is definitely something for you! 
 The warehouse Prinseneiland 5, called 'De Jonge Walvisvanger', was built between 1716 and 1721 by Abraham Kromhuijsen. The shell (facade and side walls, beams, floors, staircase and roof construction) largely dates back to this construction phase. The monumental warehouse has a rich history with many functions, from storing coffee and cocoa to framing and housing for a residential group. 
 The national monument has recently been restored to a high standard and sustainably restored into twelve beautiful luxury apartments. For example, an elevator has been installed, energy-efficient installations have been used, all facades, ceilings and floors have been insulated (soundproof) and HR++ insulating glass has been used where possible. By preserving the original 18th century stairs, floor beams and warehouse doors, the characteristic appearance has been preserved. 
 Location 
 The warehouse is located on one of the three Western Islands in the centre of Amsterdam. These islands form a small atmospheric world in themselves. Nowadays, due to its secluded location, it is one of the most sought-after, quietest and most atmospheric neighbourhoods in Amsterdam. You can do your daily shopping on foot on the pleasant Haarlemmerdijk, Haarlemmerstraat and in the Jordaan behind it, where you can also find numerous cafés, restaurants and shops. 
 Prinseneiland is 10 minutes from Central Station and the nearest bus stop on Haarlemmerplein is only 400 metres away. 
 It is a nice place to live quietly, but due to its central location it is a wonderful base for a dynamic life. 
 Layout 
 Via a high-quality upholstered and painted staircase with a modern lift, you reach the entrance of the apartment on the 4th floor. 
 The bathroom and bedroom are located in the entrance hall. The bedroom is spacious and has a large built-in wardrobe. The bathroom is also spacious and equipped with a walk-in shower, a wall-mounted toilet, a large sink with storage space, a good extractor fan and connections for a washing machine and a dryer. 
Then you reach the spacious living room over the entire width of the building, equipped with a spacious dining kitchen, large windows with a beautiful view of the attractive courtyards and a second room. 
Despite the authentic feeling that the building gives you, the kitchen is characterized by its modern character. The stylish color combinations are a feast for the eyes. The modern kitchen has a natural stone top and is also equipped with all desired built-in appliances, such as an oven-microwave combination, fridge-freezer, dishwasher, induction hob and extractor hood. All from the Siemens brand. 
 The house is also fully equipped with beautiful panel doors with stainless steel door and window handles, a high-quality floor finish with high skirting boards, energy-efficient LED built-in lighting and beautiful switching material, as well as an HR CV system, security locks and an intercom with intercom at the entrance door on the ground floor and in the house. In addition, the living room and bedrooms are equipped with curtains. 
 Everything in the house exudes comfort and luxury. A great combination of monumental and modern living pleasure where the apartment has been sustainably renovated (energy label A+, which ensures lower energy costs). The shell and the common areas are sustainably maintained, which includes cleaning the stairwell, maintenance of installations and window cleaning.

 This corner house is really super central in Papendrecht, but also central to several major cities. And whether you prefer to go by car or public transport, both are a great option from here. After a long day at work you don't want to have to look for a parking spot, with your own private parking space you don't have to. 
 The house is within walking distance of the shopping street and numerous eateries, cafes and restaurants. The train station is also within walking and cycling distance. 
 The property is truly a hidden jewel, you easily drive past it without knowing what you actually missed. And that's just the beginning. Modern and centrally located with a generous roof terrace. Located in a quiet neighborhood with shopping around the corner. This cozy home offers the best of both worlds: quiet surroundings and all amenities at your fingertips.

 LOCATION 
 Recht Boomssloot is a charming and somewhat lesser-known and quiet canal in the heart of Amsterdam, located in the central district. The street runs parallel to the famous canals and offers a picturesque and peaceful setting, while still providing easy access to the city's vibrant culture. This street is part of the historic center of Amsterdam, where you will find a mix of traditional and modern architecture, picturesque canals and proximity to some of the city's most important sights, such as the Noorderkerk, the Jordaan and the lively Nieuwmarktplein. Despite its central location, the street is relatively quiet, making it an ideal place for those looking for a peaceful living environment, yet close to everything the city has to offer.

The apartment will be delivered according to the most recent, sustainable standards and is fully equipped with underfloor heating, heat pump and natural ventilation. 
 Location: 
Initially hidden -  this is where the surprise awaits when you take the entrance at 38 De Ruijterstraat and leave the busy street behind. The apartment looks slender, bright and light, due to the construction of the building and the extensive use of glass. Within a few minutes you are at the 'royal' Noordeinde with its art shops, restaurants, bars and of course the palace, as well as vibrant city center. Ideally situated in relation to the city and the beach!  
 Layout: 
Street level entrance. Entrance through the hall/sun room, where your eyes catch the glass roof. To the rear, the living room flows into the dining and cooking area. Because that space is lower than the living room, there is a natural separation between the two spaces on the ground floor. On the first floor are the two bedrooms and the luxurious bathroom. You will also find a beautiful, open space which can serve as a walk-in closet, office or sitting room. Here too, light plays the leading role, because here you can enjoy the sun, or if you prefer, you can sleep here with a view of the stars! Via the stairs the roof terrace is reachable.

 The Location and Building: 
 What makes living in the Kop van Noord so special? First, it’s the vibrant atmosphere created by the mix of cultures and the prime location. From traditional to urban, from young to old, from lively to relaxing, from classic to modern, from starter apartments to penthouses—Kop van Noord truly has something for everyone! Plus, the location is superb. It’s a lively and dynamic spot in one of Rotterdam's oldest and most charming neighborhoods. Close to chic Hillegersberg, with its green parks and lakes, and to the city center. Just a short walk from excellent public transport options, supermarkets, and major roads just minutes away. On the edge of a world-class city with views of the skyline and all urban conveniences within reach, yet also sheltered, safe, and easily accessible. 
 If you're not convinced yet, the key advantage might be sustainability.

 Brunssum 
There are indications that in prehistoric times there was already habitation in the area around Brunssum. This also applies to the neighboring municipalities of Heerlen and Landgraaf. Little is known about this occupation. Finds from the soil and medieval records indicate an uninterrupted occupation of this area during the last 2,000 years. 
In the Middle Ages, the land defenses in the Schutterspark were erected for protection. 
The parish of Brunssum is known since 1150, and formed with Schinveld and Jabeek a bench of aldermen within the Land of Valkenburg. In 1557, the aldermanic district of Brunssum, consisting of Brunssum, Schinveld and Jabeek, was elevated to a seigniory by the government of the Spanish Netherlands and pledged to the Hoen family of Amstenrade, and sold in 1609 to Arnold III Huyn of Geleen. In 1664, this fiefdom of Brunssum merged into the county of Geleen and Amstenrade. At the end of the ancien régime per 1794 Brunssum became an independent municipality. 
In 1150 there was already a St. Gregory's Church in the center and in 1579 it was elevated to a parish church. The present church is modern. 
Neither seals nor seal images are known from the bench of aldermen or the parish. The coat of arms is therefore composed of the coat of arms of the Huyn family and the parish saint.

 Beeklaan 341 was restored and repurposed into three apartments in 2011. The building style is typical of the period around 1900, featuring what is known as transitional architecture, which aligns with Art Deco and Jugendstil. Given the modest design of the ground-floor shopfront, it is presumed that it dates back to the 1930s. The property was most likely originally used as a residential space, with one unit on the ground floor and a triplex apartment above. 
 LAYOUT 
 The entrance to the apartment is on the first floor. This floor also features the double living room, with a balcony off the back room, and one bedroom. On the second floor, there are two bedrooms, one with a charming balcony on the street corner, as well as the bathroom.

 For this precious apartment we are looking to find a tenant who takes great care of the place as well as one to enjoy its great location and its versatile layout with three (3) separate bedrooms! It feels like an 80+ m2 apartment because of its layout.

 The building has been completely rebuilt in 2013, delivering the apartment a label A for energy efficiency, and has been refurbished in November 2020. Located on the second floor one enters the apartment in a hallway that connects to all the rooms of the apartment (see floorplan).
