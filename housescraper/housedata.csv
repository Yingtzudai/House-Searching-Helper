 Complex and Surroundings 
This modern apartment complex (opened in the summer of 2020) sits at the crossroad of the monumental city streets Mathenesserlaan and Heemraadssingel, the latter one being known for its famous canal and green walking area.  The building itself has been entirely transformed, from a school building into a residential complex, of which only the structural beams and columns of the old building remained partly visible from the inside.   
 The surrounding neighbourhood has undergone major developments, while most of the houses and buildings in the area were built at the beginning of the previous century, more and more hip and alternative spots have opened lately. The apartment complex is perfectly located in the western part of the city centre, while it remained a quiet location it is still in the immediate vicinity of active and pleasant street life. There are various trendy shops, cafes and restaurants in the surrounding streets, like the Nieuwe Binnenweg, 2e Middellandstraat and Vierambachtsstraat. Besides, both parks and cultural facilities – including museums, theatres, cinemas and the well-known Blijdorp zoo – are all within easy reach.   
 Rotterdam Central Station can easily be reached by foot or bicycle, there are various public transport options (Bus, Tram, Metro, Train), and the ring road is also quickly and easily accessible by car. 
 Lay out 
Modern, lightful central hall to entry the building complex with access to the mailboxes and elevators. The central hall contains a ‘bring-me-box’ locker system where your parcels can be brought and safeguarded when you are not at home.   
 The entrance of the apartment is located on the ground floor, directly accessible from the central hall.

The apartment is located in the popular Rivierenbuurt around the corner from the Maasstraat. The Maasstraat and Scheldestraat are around the corner, putting a wide variety of attractive restaurants, cafes and specialty stores within easy reach. The Amstelpark, Martin Luther Kingpark and Beatrixpark are all within walking distance, so it couldn't be easier to visit annual festivals such as De Parade, Taste of Amsterdam and Pure Markt. In short, this apartment is located in the heart of the beloved Rivierenbuurt. Easily accessible by car via the A-10 ring road, exit Rai and exit Amstel (S109 and S111) and by public transport. The location is ideal for quick access to the center or for quick access outside Amsterdam. The Beatrixpark and the Martin L. Kingpark are just a stone's throw away.

Welcome to Domus Houthaven 
Views of the city centre on one side and Amsterdam's harbours on the other. Domus Houthaven is located in the middle of the new sustainable city district, right next to the centre of Amsterdam. With 235 rental flats and various communal areas and services, everything here is geared towards modern city living. Properties are regularly available. 
 A smart home 
Domus Houthaven features a diversity of flats. Ranging from 40 sqm to 60 sqm. All homes come with solid PVC flooring, curtains and the 'smart living core' with kitchen, bathroom, cupboards, and bed. So ready to move into. 
 With many extras 
Living at Domus is living with many extra amenities. In the living room and roof garden, you walk in to work for a while or meet others. The other facilities work on a 'pay per use' basis. So no unnecessarily high service costs, but only pay for what you actually use. 
 Bringing soul into the building 
Shared spaces and facilities play a key role in Domus Living. Christa de Buvry de Mauregnault, owner of operator TO BE AT, makes sure everything is arranged and runs smoothly at the venue. 'The uniqueness of Domus lies in the combination of a smart, compact home with the possibility of extra living space in the shared living room, cooking studio and garden. This offers residents optimal living pleasure and convenience at the lowest possible ecological footprint. It is great to see that everyone uses those shared extra spaces exactly as they are intended. That goes very organically. As TO BE AT, we are there for the residents, to bring soul to this fantastic building. With hospitality, services and technology. Facility manager Marco is there every day to answer questions and pick up jobs. And community manager Rajeb himself lives in the building. He will help and inspire fellow residents to organise activities. Tenant satisfaction is already high: Domus scores a 9.3. We are proud of that and want to maintain it!'

Tomorrow's housing solutions go beyond buildings. As a service brand, we are constantly improving the daily lives of residents and our environment.

 About the project 
Welcome to Domus Houthaven 
Views of the city centre on one side and Amsterdam's harbours on the other. Domus Houthaven is located in the middle of the new sustainable city district, right next to the centre of Amsterdam. With 235 rental flats and various communal areas and services, everything here is geared towards modern city living. Properties are regularly available. 
 A smart home 
Domus Houthaven features a diversity of flats. Ranging from 40 sqm to 60 sqm. All homes come with solid PVC flooring, curtains and the 'smart living core' with kitchen, bathroom, cupboards, and bed. So ready to move into. 
 With many extras 
Living at Domus is living with many extra amenities. In the living room and roof garden, you walk in to work for a while or meet others. The other facilities work on a 'pay per use' basis. So no unnecessarily high service costs, but only pay for what you actually use. 
 Bringing soul into the building 
Shared spaces and facilities play a key role in Domus Living. Christa de Buvry de Mauregnault, owner of operator TO BE AT, makes sure everything is arranged and runs smoothly at the venue. 'The uniqueness of Domus lies in the combination of a smart, compact home with the possibility of extra living space in the shared living room, cooking studio and garden. This offers residents optimal living pleasure and convenience at the lowest possible ecological footprint. It is great to see that everyone uses those shared extra spaces exactly as they are intended. That goes very organically. As TO BE AT, we are there for the residents, to bring soul to this fantastic building. With hospitality, services and technology. Facility manager Marco is there every day to answer questions and pick up jobs. And community manager Rajeb himself lives in the building. He will help and inspire fellow residents to organise activities. Tenant satisfaction is already high: Domus scores a 9.3. We are proud of that and want to maintain it!' 
 Domus app 
Tomorrow's housing solutions go beyond buildings. As a service brand, we are constantly improving the daily lives of residents and our environment.

LOCATION 
The building is located in the Nieuw-West district, just outside the Amsterdam ring road. Supermarkets and nice cosy shops and restaurants are in the immediate vicinity. In addition, there is plenty of greenery within walking distance; on one side of the building the Sloterplas with surrounding park and on the other side the Rembrandtpark with its beautiful ponds, lawns and playgrounds and which also offers a 'green' cycling route to the city centre. The centre of Amsterdam is only 15 minutes away by bike from the apartment. At a short distance from the building are several bus, tram and metro stops via which you can be door-to-door at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport in half an hour, as well as Amsterdam Central Station. By car, you can reach the A10 motorway within minutes. 
 OUR SERVICES 
The Tenant Ambassadors from To Be At are at your service every day to provide you with an optimal living experience. Whether it's carrying out a repair request in your home, directing the cleaning when an accident has happened or just having a chat, they are happy to do so. You speak to them in the atrium, create a ticket in our own resident app or send a chat message - getting in touch has never been easier! 
With our services, we make your life easier and more fun! For example, we offer various services such as the Miele Laundry Boutique, a shared laundry facility, MyPup lockers, for receiving and sending packages in a safe and sustainable way, and you can book our cleaning service for cleaning your studio. 
Already interested in renting an apartment? Check if you are eligible and sign up to rent! 
 OUR COMMUNITY 
We're on a mission to reintroduce the element of community in urban apartment living. The ecosystem we create, helps you interact with your fellow residents while protecting your personal space. From cozy get-to-gethers to big events with your neighbors; we believe that life is infinitely more joyful when we're truly connected and never need to feel alone. 
The building has an atrium where you can work and enjoy a snack from the vending machines. Next to the atrium is the communal living room, which invites you to relax, watch a movie or play a game with your fellow residents. 
Both areas are designed to encourage interaction so you can connect with your neighbours. Both spaces are currently undergoing an 'upgrade'. They are being completely repainted and fitted with new furniture, so that these spaces can be even better used by the community and you too can really feel at home there. 
 WHAT WILL THE RENT OF AN APARTMENT COST ME? 
The basic rent is EUR 785 per month. 
In addition, you pay a service charge of EUR 176  per month. These costs are charged for the services offered, such as the caretakers (Tenant Ambassadors), cleaning, security, flooring, sunblind but also for internet and heating in your apartment. 
Service costs are an advance payment. Every year, you will receive an overview of the actual costs incurred. If applicable, the costs will be settled. 
You enter into a rent contract for one year. After that, the contract can be terminated monthly. 
There is a possibility to apply for rent allowance. Whether you are eligible for a rent allowance is of course entirely dependent on your income, you can calculate this on the website of the Dutch tax authorities. 
 AM I ELIGIBLE TO RENT AN APARTMENT? 
You are eligible to rent an apartment if you meet all these conditions: 
 
 
 I am a young professional 
 
 
 I am looking for a living environment with a community of like-minded people 
 
 
 I earn a gross salary of EUR 3140 per month

WesterparkWest 
In WesterparkWest, you live with all the comforts and facilities of the city, in the greenery of an urban square with everything you need. A good cup of coffee on the terrace, running routes through the park, in the middle of urban life with all the space and comfort. 
The old office area serves as the raw material for a new, modern residential area. From closed to open. From grey and gloomy to green and relaxed. From workplace to a relaxed residential, working and living environment. 
 One prime location, seven residential buildings 
WesterparkWest offers a wide range of high-quality rental housing spread across seven unique residential buildings: Salt, Pepper, Blend and the four Basil buildings (North, East, South and West). Together, these buildings offer 552 flats, each with its own character and appeal. Whether you are young, old, single or living together, here you will find a home that suits you. The homes range from 1-, 2-, 3- and even 4-room flats and are designed with the modern resident in mind. 
A significant proportion of the flats in Basil (95 of the 250 homes) are available for middle-income earners, according to the guidelines of the Amsterdam municipality. These homes are subject to a maximum income limit of €75,362 (price level 2024). In addition, a number of free sector flats offer the option of being shared by two house-sharing tenants. 
 Sustainable and comfortable living 
All buildings in WesterparkWest combine comfort with sustainability. The flats are connected to a WKO system, which provides regulated heating in winter and cooling in summer. They have excellent ventilation and have at least energy label A, with some homes even achieving A++ or A+++. Solar panels on the roofs provide energy for general facilities, making the buildings contribute to a more sustainable future. 
 Unique living comfort 
Each flat offers fantastic views and a carefree living experience. Smart layouts, modern amenities and a peaceful living environment make WesterparkWest a place where everyone feels at home in the heart of Amsterdam. 
 In the green 
Westerpark is literally at your feet. Westerpark West is built and designed as a very high-quality place to live, work and recreate. Picnicking with your friends, playing football with the children, running laps with your neighbours or quietly enjoying the view from your own terrace: it's all possible here. We try to make 'time' here into Quality Time in every way possible. We do this with good facilities for the entire neighbourhood (think catering establishments, day nurseries) and smart, comfortable buildings (use of sustainable installations and state-of-the-art technology). In addition, we examine whether and how we can provide a possible programme of shared and personal services, such as cleaning and concierge services. 
 Location 
Everything within walking distance and by bike you will experience a wide variety of city activities within 15 minutes. Fine dining, cinema, theatre, strolling, concerts Amsterdam offers so much and from WesterParkWest everything is within easy reach. If you do want to get out of the city, the motorway, train or metro are within easy reach.",,Flat,A++,,For rent: Flat Haarlemmerweg 1040 in Amsterdam,https://www.pararius.com/apartment-for-rent/amsterdam/e892cb60/haarlemmerweg,,60.0,,2,3,04-12-2024,,1710.0,"Upstairs apartment, Apartment",Unlimited period,Excludes: Service costs,,For rent,2023

At 801 Elizabeth Cady Stantonplein, you will find this beautiful Young Professional building, completed in 2019. The building is 10 floors high and has around 500 studios specially designed for working young people aged between 18 and 36. The building is sustainable, green and natural gas-free.

 The location 
Amsterdam-Zuidoost is close to various parks such as the Nelson Mandela Park (a 5-minute walk). There is also a nice shopping centre at 1-minute walking distance: Amsterdamse Poort. Amsterdam-Zuidoost is easily accessible by public transport. Both train station and metro station Amsterdam Bijlmer Arena are only a 10-minute walk away. There are also many bus connections, making it easy to reach small nearby towns as well. 
 Our service 
You enter the building with a badge system. At the entrance, you can choose to take the lift to your studio or take the stairs to the atrium. In the spacious atrium, you can meet other residents or find a quiet place to work. Next to the atrium is the communal living room, here too you can meet fellow residents or find some relaxation!

Welcome to Domus Houthaven 
Views of the city centre on one side and Amsterdam's harbours on the other. Domus Houthaven is located in the middle of the new sustainable city district, right next to the centre of Amsterdam. With 235 rental flats and various communal areas and services, everything here is geared towards modern city living. Properties are regularly available. 
 A smart home 
Domus Houthaven features a diversity of flats. Ranging from 40 sqm to 60 sqm. All homes come with solid PVC flooring, curtains and the 'smart living core' with kitchen, bathroom, cupboards, and bed. So ready to move into. 
 With many extras 
Living at Domus is living with many extra amenities. In the living room and roof garden, you walk in to work for a while or meet others. The other facilities work on a 'pay per use' basis. So no unnecessarily high service costs, but only pay for what you actually use. 
 Bringing soul into the building 
Shared spaces and facilities play a key role in Domus Living. Christa de Buvry de Mauregnault, owner of operator TO BE AT, makes sure everything is arranged and runs smoothly at the venue. 'The uniqueness of Domus lies in the combination of a smart, compact home with the possibility of extra living space in the shared living room, cooking studio and garden. This offers residents optimal living pleasure and convenience at the lowest possible ecological footprint. It is great to see that everyone uses those shared extra spaces exactly as they are intended. That goes very organically. As TO BE AT, we are there for the residents, to bring soul to this fantastic building. With hospitality, services and technology. Facility manager Marco is there every day to answer questions and pick up jobs. And community manager Rajeb himself lives in the building. He will help and inspire fellow residents to organise activities. Tenant satisfaction is already high: Domus scores a 9.3. We are proud of that and want to maintain it!' 
 Domus app 
Tomorrow's housing solutions go beyond buildings. As a service brand, we are constantly improving the daily lives of residents and our environment.

LOCATION 
The building is located in the Nieuw-West district, just outside the Amsterdam ring road. Supermarkets and nice cosy shops and restaurants are in the immediate vicinity. In addition, there is plenty of greenery within walking distance; on one side of the building the Sloterplas with surrounding park and on the other side the Rembrandtpark with its beautiful ponds, lawns and playgrounds and which also offers a 'green' cycling route to the city centre. The centre of Amsterdam is only 15 minutes away by bike from the apartment. At a short distance from the building are several bus, tram and metro stops via which you can be door-to-door at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport in half an hour, as well as Amsterdam Central Station. By car, you can reach the A10 motorway within minutes. 
 OUR SERVICES 
The Tenant Ambassadors from To Be At are at your service every day to provide you with an optimal living experience. Whether it's carrying out a repair request in your home, directing the cleaning when an accident has happened or just having a chat, they are happy to do so. You speak to them in the atrium, create a ticket in our own resident app or send a chat message - getting in touch has never been easier! 
With our services, we make your life easier and more fun! For example, we offer various services such as the Miele Laundry Boutique, a shared laundry facility, MyPup lockers, for receiving and sending packages in a safe and sustainable way, and you can book our cleaning service for cleaning your studio. 
Already interested in renting an apartment? Check if you are eligible and sign up to rent! 
 OUR COMMUNITY 
We're on a mission to reintroduce the element of community in urban apartment living. The ecosystem we create, helps you interact with your fellow residents while protecting your personal space. From cozy get-to-gethers to big events with your neighbors; we believe that life is infinitely more joyful when we're truly connected and never need to feel alone. 
The building has an atrium where you can work and enjoy a snack from the vending machines. Next to the atrium is the communal living room, which invites you to relax, watch a movie or play a game with your fellow residents. 
Both areas are designed to encourage interaction so you can connect with your neighbours. Both spaces are currently undergoing an 'upgrade'. They are being completely repainted and fitted with new furniture, so that these spaces can be even better used by the community and you too can really feel at home there. 
 WHAT WILL THE RENT OF AN APARTMENT COST ME? 
The basic rent is EUR 785 per month. 
In addition, you pay a service charge of EUR 176  per month. These costs are charged for the services offered, such as the caretakers (Tenant Ambassadors), cleaning, security, flooring, sunblind but also for internet and heating in your apartment. 
Service costs are an advance payment. Every year, you will receive an overview of the actual costs incurred. If applicable, the costs will be settled. 
You enter into a rent contract for one year. After that, the contract can be terminated monthly. 
There is a possibility to apply for rent allowance. Whether you are eligible for a rent allowance is of course entirely dependent on your income, you can calculate this on the website of the Dutch tax authorities. 
 AM I ELIGIBLE TO RENT AN APARTMENT? 
You are eligible to rent an apartment if you meet all these conditions: 
 
 
 I am a young professional 
 
 
 I am looking for a living environment with a community of like-minded people 
 
 
 I earn a gross salary of EUR 3140 per month

Living at Domus is living with many extra amenities. In the living room and roof garden, you walk in to work for a while or meet others. The other facilities work on a 'pay per use' basis. So no unnecessarily high service costs, but only pay for what you actually use. 
 Bringing soul into the building 
Shared spaces and facilities play a key role in Domus Living. Christa de Buvry de Mauregnault, owner of operator TO BE AT, makes sure everything is arranged and runs smoothly at the venue. 'The uniqueness of Domus lies in the combination of a smart, compact home with the possibility of extra living space in the shared living room, cooking studio and garden. This offers residents optimal living pleasure and convenience at the lowest possible ecological footprint. It is great to see that everyone uses those shared extra spaces exactly as they are intended. That goes very organically. As TO BE AT, we are there for the residents, to bring soul to this fantastic building. With hospitality, services and technology. Facility manager Marco is there every day to answer questions and pick up jobs. And community manager Rajeb himself lives in the building. He will help and inspire fellow residents to organise activities. Tenant satisfaction is already high: Domus scores a 9.3. We are proud of that and want to maintain it!'

 OUR COMMUNITY 
We're on a mission to reintroduce the element of community in urban apartment living. The ecosystem we create, helps you interact with your fellow residents while protecting your personal space. From cozy get-to-gethers to big events with your neighbors; we believe that life is infinitely more joyful when we're truly connected and never need to feel alone. 
The building has an atrium where you can work and enjoy a snack from the vending machines. Next to the atrium is the communal living room, which invites you to relax, watch a movie or play a game with your fellow residents. 
Both areas are designed to encourage interaction so you can connect with your neighbours. Both spaces are currently undergoing an 'upgrade'. They are being completely repainted and fitted with new furniture, so that these spaces can be even better used by the community and you too can really feel at home there. 
 WHAT WILL THE RENT OF AN APARTMENT COST ME? 
The basic rent is EUR 785 per month. 
In addition, you pay a service charge of EUR 176  per month. These costs are charged for the services offered, such as the caretakers (Tenant Ambassadors), cleaning, security, flooring, sunblind but also for internet and heating in your apartment. 
Service costs are an advance payment. Every year, you will receive an overview of the actual costs incurred. If applicable, the costs will be settled. 
You enter into a rent contract for one year. After that, the contract can be terminated monthly. 
There is a possibility to apply for rent allowance. Whether you are eligible for a rent allowance is of course entirely dependent on your income, you can calculate this on the website of the Dutch tax authorities. 
 AM I ELIGIBLE TO RENT AN APARTMENT? 
You are eligible to rent an apartment if you meet all these conditions: 
 
 
 I am a young professional 
 
 
 I am looking for a living environment with a community of like-minded people 
 
 
 I earn a gross salary of EUR 3140 per month 
 
 
 I want to rent for at least one year

Whether it's carrying out a repair request in your home, directing the cleaning when an accident has happened or just having a chat, they are happy to do so. You speak to them in the atrium, create a ticket in our own resident app or send a chat message - getting in touch has never been easier! 
With our services, we make your life easier and more fun! For example, we offer various services such as the Miele Laundry Boutique, a shared laundry facility, MyPup lockers, for receiving and sending packages in a safe and sustainable way, and you can book our cleaning service for cleaning your studio. 
Already interested in renting an apartment? Check if you are eligible and sign up to rent! 
 OUR COMMUNITY 
We're on a mission to reintroduce the element of community in urban apartment living. The ecosystem we create, helps you interact with your fellow residents while protecting your personal space. From cozy get-to-gethers to big events with your neighbors; we believe that life is infinitely more joyful when we're truly connected and never need to feel alone. 
The building has an atrium where you can work and enjoy a snack from the vending machines. Next to the atrium is the communal living room, which invites you to relax, watch a movie or play a game with your fellow residents. 
Both areas are designed to encourage interaction so you can connect with your neighbours. Both spaces are currently undergoing an 'upgrade'. They are being completely repainted and fitted with new furniture, so that these spaces can be even better used by the community and you too can really feel at home there. 
 WHAT WILL THE RENT OF AN APARTMENT COST ME? 
The basic rent is EUR 785 per month. 
In addition, you pay a service charge of EUR 176  per month. These costs are charged for the services offered, such as the caretakers (Tenant Ambassadors), cleaning, security, flooring, sunblind but also for internet and heating in your apartment. 
Service costs are an advance payment. Every year, you will receive an overview of the actual costs incurred. If applicable, the costs will be settled. 
You enter into a rent contract for one year. After that, the contract can be terminated monthly. 
There is a possibility to apply for rent allowance. Whether you are eligible for a rent allowance is of course entirely dependent on your income, you can calculate this on the website of the Dutch tax authorities. 
 AM I ELIGIBLE TO RENT AN APARTMENT? 
You are eligible to rent an apartment if you meet all these conditions: 
 
 
 I am a young professional 
 
 
 I am looking for a living environment with a community of like-minded people 
 
 
 I earn a gross salary of EUR 3140 per month 
 
 
 I want to rent for at least one year 
 
 
 PLEASE NOTE: because the basic rent is social rent, a housing permit is necessary for every tenant. Your annual income must therefore not be too high, among other things (limit: gross annual income €55,629.)

                                                         High-quality and luxuriously renovated 4-room upper apartment located on the Singel, near Blauwburgwal and the quaint streets of the Jordaan district. 
This tasteful and pleasantly designed apartment with spacious roof terrace has approximately 125 m2 of living space and is located on the fourth and fifth floor (US counting) of a Monumental building (built in 1906) with stately entrance. 
 LAY-OUT 
 The entrance to the building is formed by a stately and well-maintained entrance equipped with an intercom system with camera. By means of the shared stairwell, you reach the entrance of the home, which is located on the second floor. 
 By means of the in-house staircase, you reach the fourth floor (US counting). Here you will find the bright and spacious living room (approximately 60 m2) with windows along the entire length of both sides, and the adjoining luxury kitchen and roof terrace. From the living room (4 windows wide), you have a unique, breath-taking view of the Singel and Blauwburgwal. 
 The custom kitchen (solid wood) is equipped with a beautiful marble countertop and various built-in appliances, such as a dishwasher, oven/microwave, 5-burner hob with designer stainless steel hood, refrigerator/freezer and a Quooker. 
 Through the French doors at the back of the apartment (location: southeast), you have access to a beautiful, spacious roof terrace measuring approximately 22 m2. 
Using the in-house staircase, you reach the bedroom floor with imposing beam construction, with ceilings that reach heights of up to approximately 4 metres. Here, you will find three full and ample-sized bedrooms, a luxurious bathroom and a separate laundry room. 
 The master bedroom has a surface area of approximately 14 m2 and feels very spacious thanks to the high ceilings. The luxury bathroom is equipped with a washbasin (double sinks), toilet, walk-in shower with rainshower, bath and towel radiator.

 Across the upper floor, the wooden trusses and beams have been beautifully exposed. The solid wood floor panels are taken from a former ship from the VOC era. 
 During the full renovation (2017), only high-quality materials were used, which has created a very high level of finishing quality (e.g. panel doors, herringbone floor and ornaments). Naturally, numerous original features were retained that contribute to the Monumental feeling of living in the Amsterdam canal district.

LOCATION 
The building is located in the Nieuw-West district, just outside the Amsterdam ring road. Supermarkets and nice cosy shops and restaurants are in the immediate vicinity. In addition, there is plenty of greenery within walking distance; on one side of the building the Sloterplas with surrounding park and on the other side the Rembrandtpark with its beautiful ponds, lawns and playgrounds and which also offers a 'green' cycling route to the city centre. The centre of Amsterdam is only 15 minutes away by bike from the apartment. At a short distance from the building are several bus, tram and metro stops via which you can be door-to-door at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport in half an hour, as well as Amsterdam Central Station. By car, you can reach the A10 motorway within minutes. 
 OUR SERVICES 
The Tenant Ambassadors from To Be At are at your service every day to provide you with an optimal living experience. Whether it's carrying out a repair request in your home, directing the cleaning when an accident has happened or just having a chat, they are happy to do so. You speak to them in the atrium, create a ticket in our own resident app or send a chat message - getting in touch has never been easier! 
With our services, we make your life easier and more fun! For example, we offer various services such as the Miele Laundry Boutique, a shared laundry facility, MyPup lockers, for receiving and sending packages in a safe and sustainable way, and you can book our cleaning service for cleaning your studio. 
Already interested in renting an apartment? Check if you are eligible and sign up to rent! 
 OUR COMMUNITY 
We're on a mission to reintroduce the element of community in urban apartment living. The ecosystem we create, helps you interact with your fellow residents while protecting your personal space. From cozy get-to-gethers to big events with your neighbors; we believe that life is infinitely more joyful when we're truly connected and never need to feel alone. 
The building has an atrium where you can work and enjoy a snack from the vending machines. Next to the atrium is the communal living room, which invites you to relax, watch a movie or play a game with your fellow residents. 
Both areas are designed to encourage interaction so you can connect with your neighbours. Both spaces are currently undergoing an 'upgrade'. They are being completely repainted and fitted with new furniture, so that these spaces can be even better used by the community and you too can really feel at home there. 
 WHAT WILL THE RENT OF AN APARTMENT COST ME? 
The basic rent is EUR 785 per month. 
In addition, you pay a service charge of EUR 176  per month. These costs are charged for the services offered, such as the caretakers (Tenant Ambassadors), cleaning, security, flooring, sunblind but also for internet and heating in your apartment. 
Service costs are an advance payment. Every year, you will receive an overview of the actual costs incurred. If applicable, the costs will be settled. 
You enter into a rent contract for one year. After that, the contract can be terminated monthly. 
There is a possibility to apply for rent allowance. Whether you are eligible for a rent allowance is of course entirely dependent on your income, you can calculate this on the website of the Dutch tax authorities. 
 AM I ELIGIBLE TO RENT AN APARTMENT? 
You are eligible to rent an apartment if you meet all these conditions: 
 
 
 I am a young professional 
 
 
 I am looking for a living environment with a community of like-minded people 
 
 
 I earn a gross salary of EUR 3140 per month

Welcome to Domus Houthaven 
Views of the city centre on one side and Amsterdam's harbours on the other. Domus Houthaven is located in the middle of the new sustainable city district, right next to the centre of Amsterdam. With 235 rental flats and various communal areas and services, everything here is geared towards modern city living. Properties are regularly available. 
 A smart home 
Domus Houthaven features a diversity of flats. Ranging from 40 sqm to 60 sqm. All homes come with solid PVC flooring, curtains and the 'smart living core' with kitchen, bathroom, cupboards, and bed. So ready to move into. 
 With many extras 
Living at Domus is living with many extra amenities. In the living room and roof garden, you walk in to work for a while or meet others. The other facilities work on a 'pay per use' basis. So no unnecessarily high service costs, but only pay for what you actually use. 
 Bringing soul into the building 
Shared spaces and facilities play a key role in Domus Living. Christa de Buvry de Mauregnault, owner of operator TO BE AT, makes sure everything is arranged and runs smoothly at the venue. 'The uniqueness of Domus lies in the combination of a smart, compact home with the possibility of extra living space in the shared living room, cooking studio and garden. This offers residents optimal living pleasure and convenience at the lowest possible ecological footprint. It is great to see that everyone uses those shared extra spaces exactly as they are intended. That goes very organically. As TO BE AT, we are there for the residents, to bring soul to this fantastic building. With hospitality, services and technology. Facility manager Marco is there every day to answer questions and pick up jobs. And community manager Rajeb himself lives in the building. He will help and inspire fellow residents to organise activities. Tenant satisfaction is already high: Domus scores a 9.3. We are proud of that and want to maintain it!'

Tomorrow's housing solutions go beyond buildings. As a service brand, we are constantly improving the daily lives of residents and our environment.

In addition, there is plenty of greenery within walking distance; on one side of the building the Sloterplas with surrounding park and on the other side the Rembrandtpark with its beautiful ponds, lawns and playgrounds and which also offers a 'green' cycling route to the city centre. The centre of Amsterdam is only 15 minutes away by bike from the apartment.

Already interested in renting an apartment? Check if you are eligible and sign up to rent! 
 OUR COMMUNITY 
We're on a mission to reintroduce the element of community in urban apartment living. The ecosystem we create, helps you interact with your fellow residents while protecting your personal space. From cozy get-to-gethers to big events with your neighbors; we believe that life is infinitely more joyful when we're truly connected and never need to feel alone. 
The building has an atrium where you can work and enjoy a snack from the vending machines. Next to the atrium is the communal living room, which invites you to relax, watch a movie or play a game with your fellow residents. 
Both areas are designed to encourage interaction so you can connect with your neighbours. Both spaces are currently undergoing an 'upgrade'. They are being completely repainted and fitted with new furniture, so that these spaces can be even better used by the community and you too can really feel at home there. 
 WHAT WILL THE RENT OF AN APARTMENT COST ME? 
The basic rent is EUR 785 per month. 
In addition, you pay a service charge of EUR 176  per month. These costs are charged for the services offered, such as the caretakers (Tenant Ambassadors), cleaning, security, flooring, sunblind but also for internet and heating in your apartment. 
Service costs are an advance payment. Every year, you will receive an overview of the actual costs incurred. If applicable, the costs will be settled. 
You enter into a rent contract for one year. After that, the contract can be terminated monthly. 
There is a possibility to apply for rent allowance. Whether you are eligible for a rent allowance is of course entirely dependent on your income, you can calculate this on the website of the Dutch tax authorities.

It was one of the first garden city developments in the Netherlands, designed in the early 20th century. Zuidplein shopping center, with its numerous shops, is just around the corner, and the metro at this shopping center takes you to Rotterdam central station and the city center in 10 minutes.

 About the project 
WesterparkWest 
In WesterparkWest, you live with all the comforts and facilities of the city, in the greenery of an urban square with everything you need. A good cup of coffee on the terrace, running routes through the park, in the middle of urban life with all the space and comfort. 
The old office area serves as the raw material for a new, modern residential area. From closed to open. From grey and gloomy to green and relaxed. From workplace to a relaxed residential, working and living environment. 
 One prime location, seven residential buildings 
WesterparkWest offers a wide range of high-quality rental housing spread across seven unique residential buildings: Salt, Pepper, Blend and the four Basil buildings (North, East, South and West). Together, these buildings offer 552 flats, each with its own character and appeal. Whether you are young, old, single or living together, here you will find a home that suits you. The homes range from 1-, 2-, 3- and even 4-room flats and are designed with the modern resident in mind. 
A significant proportion of the flats in Basil (95 of the 250 homes) are available for middle-income earners, according to the guidelines of the Amsterdam municipality. These homes are subject to a maximum income limit of €75,362 (price level 2024). In addition, a number of free sector flats offer the option of being shared by two house-sharing tenants. 
 Sustainable and comfortable living 
All buildings in WesterparkWest combine comfort with sustainability. The flats are connected to a WKO system, which provides regulated heating in winter and cooling in summer. They have excellent ventilation and have at least energy label A, with some homes even achieving A++ or A+++. Solar panels on the roofs provide energy for general facilities, making the buildings contribute to a more sustainable future. 
 Unique living comfort 
Each flat offers fantastic views and a carefree living experience. Smart layouts, modern amenities and a peaceful living environment make WesterparkWest a place where everyone feels at home in the heart of Amsterdam. 
 In the green 
Westerpark is literally at your feet. Westerpark West is built and designed as a very high-quality place to live, work and recreate. Picnicking with your friends, playing football with the children, running laps with your neighbours or quietly enjoying the view from your own terrace: it's all possible here. We try to make 'time' here into Quality Time in every way possible. We do this with good facilities for the entire neighbourhood (think catering establishments, day nurseries) and smart, comfortable buildings (use of sustainable installations and state-of-the-art technology). In addition, we examine whether and how we can provide a possible programme of shared and personal services, such as cleaning and concierge services.

WesterparkWest 
In WesterparkWest, you live with all the comforts and facilities of the city, in the greenery of an urban square with everything you need. A good cup of coffee on the terrace, running routes through the park, in the middle of urban life with all the space and comfort. 
The old office area serves as the raw material for a new, modern residential area. From closed to open. From grey and gloomy to green and relaxed. From workplace to a relaxed residential, working and living environment. 
 One prime location, seven residential buildings 
WesterparkWest offers a wide range of high-quality rental housing spread across seven unique residential buildings: Salt, Pepper, Blend and the four Basil buildings (North, East, South and West). Together, these buildings offer 552 flats, each with its own character and appeal. Whether you are young, old, single or living together, here you will find a home that suits you. The homes range from 1-, 2-, 3- and even 4-room flats and are designed with the modern resident in mind. 
A significant proportion of the flats in Basil (95 of the 250 homes) are available for middle-income earners, according to the guidelines of the Amsterdam municipality. These homes are subject to a maximum income limit of €75,362 (price level 2024). In addition, a number of free sector flats offer the option of being shared by two house-sharing tenants. 
 Sustainable and comfortable living 
All buildings in WesterparkWest combine comfort with sustainability. The flats are connected to a WKO system, which provides regulated heating in winter and cooling in summer. They have excellent ventilation and have at least energy label A, with some homes even achieving A++ or A+++. Solar panels on the roofs provide energy for general facilities, making the buildings contribute to a more sustainable future. 
 Unique living comfort 
Each flat offers fantastic views and a carefree living experience. Smart layouts, modern amenities and a peaceful living environment make WesterparkWest a place where everyone feels at home in the heart of Amsterdam.

Westerpark is literally at your feet. Westerpark West is built and designed as a very high-quality place to live, work and recreate.

We do this with good facilities for the entire neighbourhood (think catering establishments, day nurseries) and smart, comfortable buildings (use of sustainable installations and state-of-the-art technology).

 Proud to offer this high class apartment in the De Vijzel-building in the new developed area of Oostenburg, right along the waterfront. Its location on the 4th floor ensures beautiful views over the marina and the Wittenburg district. The two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment, used as a pied-à-terre since completion, is still in excellent condition.   
 BUILDING 
With its cast-iron architecture, the ""De VIJZEL"" complex directly references the industrial SoHo district in New York, fitting in with Oostenburg's industrial history. From De Vijzel, which stands five stories high, you have a wide view over the Wittenburgervaart and the inner city of Amsterdam. The focus of De Vijzel is outward. The front faces VOC-Kade, while the back overlooks a public courtyard. The building is an example of circular construction, with concrete in the load-bearing structure made from crushed, recycled materials, and the bricks are fully circular. 
 LAY OUT 
Communal entrance with mailboxes, elevator to the 4th floor, hallway with separate toilet, guest bathroom with walk-in shower, sink and design heater, living located on the waterfront with access to the spacious balcony, open Poggenpohl kitchen equipped with island, dark worktop, induction hob with integrated extractor fan, dishwasher, fridge/freezer, oven and combination oven/microwave, master bedroom with walk in closet area and ensuite bathroom with; bath, shower double sink and second toilet, second good sized bedroom,  spacious storage area next to the kitchen with washer/dryer connection.

 AREA 
Oostenburg Island has transformed into an exciting, waterfront neighborhood with a rich mix of buildings and functions. It is very popular with café-restaurants like Roest and Rosa & Rita. This part of the city center, near the Czaar Peterstraat, has been transformed into a typical Amsterdam city district: contrasting, lively, and robust. Close to the center, by the water, and with all amenities on the island. There is plenty of room for unique shops, cozy coffee spots, inspiring co working spaces, original restaurants, and motivating sports facilities. The green roofs on the various buildings are also a conscious choice. 
 Oostenburg Island is car-free. Cyclists and pedestrians have all the space! There are plenty of recreational opportunities, including the nearby Funenpark. 
 ACCESSIBILITY AND PARKING: 
Oostenburg is easy to reach. The Piet Hein tunnel provides quick access to the A-10 ring road. Central Station is also within close reach. In the nearby Czaar Peterstraat, you’ll find tram 7, which can take you to both the KNSM island and the Rijksmuseum, or even further to Sloterpark in Nieuw-West. Oostenburg's design is consciously car-free, meaning parking is available but limited, for example, in the garage operated by Q-Park or in the Stadswerf parking garage. Cyclists are particularly well-served, thanks in part to the indoor bicycle storage you can use as a resident.

 LOCATION 
Scheveningen is a lively neighbourhood with dunes, beaches and the sea within walking distance. You can enjoy these every day if you live in Scheveningen. Go for a walk on the beach at sunset, hit the waves for a solid surfing session, or relax on a towel with a good book. If you’re looking for something a little different from the dunes, the beach and the sea, Scheveningen also borders an area with a number of beautiful parks, including the Scheveningse Bosjes, Westbroekpark and Hubertuspark. The district consists of the Dorp (Village), Haven (Harbor) and Bad (Bath) areas, each with its own character. 
With its characteristic Oude Kerk and Keizerstraat, the ‘Dorp’ is the meeting point for many residents. Densely clustered courts with narrow streets give some areas an authentic fishing village atmosphere. Keizerstraat is the oldest and most historic shopping street in Scheveningen. There are many small shops and restaurants, but also a large supermarket. 
Scheveningen ‘Haven’ has three different characters. The first inner harbor is the fishing port where fresh fish comes in daily and the rugged character is visible. There are nice cafés and restaurants around the second harbor, and sailing boats are moored there. There are also new apartment buildings with beautiful views. In the future there will be different kinds of dwellings appearing around the third harbor in a unique new development area. 
‘Bad’ boasts the historic Kurhaus, a cinema and the Circus Theater. These, together with the beautiful revamped promenade and the many beach pavilions, make this the tourism centre of Scheveningen. However, the residents of the district often also seek out the friendly hustle and bustle for a night out or just a stroll. (******)

 SURROUNDINGS 
Scheveningen is a lively neighbourhood with dunes, beaches and the sea within walking distance. You can enjoy these every day if you live in Scheveningen. Go for a walk on the beach at sunset, hit the waves for a solid surfing session, or relax on a towel with a good book. If you’re looking for something a little different from the dunes, the beach and the sea, Scheveningen also borders an area with a number of beautiful parks, including the Scheveningse Bosjes, Westbroekpark and Hubertuspark. The district consists of the Dorp (Village), Haven (Harbour) and Bad (Bath) areas, each with its own character. 
With its characteristic Oude Kerk and Keijzerstraat, the ‘Dorp’ is the meeting point for many residents. Densely clustered courts with narrow streets give some areas an authentic fishing village atmosphere. Keizerstraat is the oldest and most historic shopping street in Scheveningen. There are many small shops and eateries, but also a large supermarket. 
Scheveningen ‘Haven’ has three different characters. The first inner harbour is the fishing port where fresh fish comes in every day and the rugged character is visible. There are nice cafés and restaurants around the second harbour, and sailing boats are moored there. There are also new apartment buildings with beautiful views. In the future there will be different kinds of dwellings appearing around the third harbour in a unique new development area. 
‘Bad’ boasts the historic Kurhaus, a cinema and the Circus Theater. These, together with the beautiful revamped promenade and the many beach pavilions, make this the tourism centre of Scheveningen. However, the residents of the district often also seek out the friendly hustle and bustle for a night out or just a stroll.  
 PUBLIC TRANSPORT 
There are several public transport options in and around Scheveningen, with transport to the center of The Hague, Holland Spoor and Central Station:

 Bathroom The bathroom exudes a unique combination of luxury and tranquility. The highlight is the very spacious walk-in shower, equipped with a luxurious rain shower seamlessly integrated into the ceiling and a subtle, wall-mounted thermostat. These modern details create a sleek and minimalist design while simultaneously offering a refreshing shower experience. The rustic charm of the bathroom is enhanced by a carefully chosen accent wall and stone sinks, which evoke a sense of calm and serenity. The double vanity unit not only offers plenty of storage space but is also topped with an elegant marble countertop, giving the space a timeless appearance. A matte black designer radiator completes the look, adding both functionality and style to this thoughtfully designed bathroom.

 Area: 
Van Eeghenstraat 29B and 31 are located in the Oud-Zuid district. It is a quiet, green and friendly neighborhood. Amsterdam Oud-Zuid is one of the most prestigious neighborhoods to live in in the city! The houses are located in the heart of the Museum Quarter. The house is located on the edge of the Vondelpark, in the immediate vicinity of the Museumplein and various luxury shopping streets (including Cornelis Schuytstraat, P.C. Hooftstraat and Van Baerlestraat). From a cultural point of view, you are also in a super location with the Concertgebouw around the corner, as well as the internationally renowned museums: the Rijksmuseum, Stedelijk Museum and Van Gogh Museum. For daily shopping you can go to the Albert Hein on the Museumplein or Marqt on the Overtoom. The houses are easily accessible by public transport (trams and buses) and by car you can easily reach the A-10 ring road, A-2, A-4 and Schiphol Airport via the various roads. 
 Project information: 
The renovation concerns two individual buildings: Van Eeghenstraat 29B and 31. A large-scale renovation has ensured that the buildings once again meet the requirements of today and at the same time retain their unique appearance. Both the exterior and the interior have been restored and where necessary renewed. New roofs, window frames and fronts have been installed, the masonry has been repaired and the floors have been reinforced. At the rear, the current balconies have been completely renovated. 
 During the renovation, a lot of attention is paid to sustainability. The floors, roofs and walls have been re-insulated. All apartments have underfloor heating and LED lighting. 
 A style of its own: 
All apartments have been given a high-quality finish and a completely individual style. The style was designed by Heyligers Architects and can best be described as 'Amsterdam chic meets Scandinavian minimalism'. A style that stands for many details, moldings and clean lines, for natural materials, minimalism and for serene tranquility. Many light shades have been used in the apartments, which are combined with dark, steel fronts. In contrast to normal, clear glass, ribbed glass has been used in the steel facade, which creates a special atmosphere. The light oak floor laid in a Hungarian point, the white panel doors, the moldings around the windows and doors and the classic skirting boards provide a luxurious look. Everything has been taken into account in the apartments. For example, they are equipped with a walk-in closet and niches that offer space for decorative cabinets. 
 Kitchen: 
The kitchen is a combination of matte light gray kitchen fronts, a thin composite sand-colored worktop with light veins through which the sink runs. A brass Quooker tap completes this ton-sur-ton kitchen and will give it its own look that seamlessly matches the atmosphere in the rest of the apartment. 
 Bathroom: 
Where light shades predominate in the apartment, darker shades are used in the bathroom. For example, the walls of the shower and sink are fitted with dark wall tiles. By alternating this with a Hungarian point and cross bond, a playful effect is created. White ceramic tiles with a light gray vein have been chosen for the other walls and the floor, which, together with the bronze taps, provide a chic look. The light-dark contrast is also reflected in the washbasin furniture: slightly ribbed wooden drawers and a black marble top. The free-standing bath, separate shower and double sink complete the picture.",,Flat,A,"Present (52 m², located on the south)",For rent: Flat Van Eeghenstraat in Amsterdam,https://www.pararius.com/apartment-for-rent/amsterdam/22c8ea71/van-eeghenstraat,,135.0,2,3,4,26-11-2024,,5750.0,"Downstairs apartment, Apartment",,,,For rent,2023

 Living in a completely modern renovated, historic and characteristic warehouse from the 18th century on the charming and quiet Prinseneiland? Then this apartment is definitely something for you! 
 The warehouse Prinseneiland 5, called 'De Jonge Walvisvanger', was built between 1716 and 1721 by Abraham Kromhuijsen. The shell (facade and side walls, beams, floors, staircase and roof construction) largely dates back to this construction phase. The monumental warehouse has a rich history with many functions, from storing coffee and cocoa to framing and housing for a residential group. 
 The national monument has recently been restored to a high standard and sustainably restored into twelve beautiful luxury apartments. For example, an elevator has been installed, energy-efficient installations have been used, all facades, ceilings and floors have been insulated (soundproof) and HR++ insulating glass has been used where possible. By preserving the original 18th century stairs, floor beams and warehouse doors, the characteristic appearance has been preserved. 
 Location 
 The warehouse is located on one of the three Western Islands in the centre of Amsterdam. These islands form a small atmospheric world in themselves. Nowadays, due to its secluded location, it is one of the most sought-after, quietest and most atmospheric neighbourhoods in Amsterdam. You can do your daily shopping on foot on the pleasant Haarlemmerdijk, Haarlemmerstraat and in the Jordaan behind it, where you can also find numerous cafés, restaurants and shops. 
 Prinseneiland is 10 minutes from Central Station and the nearest bus stop on Haarlemmerplein is only 400 metres away. 
 It is a nice place to live quietly, but due to its central location it is a wonderful base for a dynamic life. 
 Layout 
 Via a high-quality upholstered and painted staircase with a modern lift, you reach the entrance of the apartment on the 4th floor. 
 The bathroom and bedroom are located in the entrance hall. The bedroom is spacious and has a large built-in wardrobe. The bathroom is also spacious and equipped with a walk-in shower, a wall-mounted toilet, a large sink with storage space, a good extractor fan and connections for a washing machine and a dryer. 
Then you reach the spacious living room over the entire width of the building, equipped with a spacious dining kitchen, large windows with a beautiful view of the attractive courtyards and a second room. 
Despite the authentic feeling that the building gives you, the kitchen is characterized by its modern character. The stylish color combinations are a feast for the eyes. The modern kitchen has a natural stone top and is also equipped with all desired built-in appliances, such as an oven-microwave combination, fridge-freezer, dishwasher, induction hob and extractor hood. All from the Siemens brand. 
 The house is also fully equipped with beautiful panel doors with stainless steel door and window handles, a high-quality floor finish with high skirting boards, energy-efficient LED built-in lighting and beautiful switching material, as well as an HR CV system, security locks and an intercom with intercom at the entrance door on the ground floor and in the house. In addition, the living room and bedrooms are equipped with curtains. 
 Everything in the house exudes comfort and luxury. A great combination of monumental and modern living pleasure where the apartment has been sustainably renovated (energy label A+, which ensures lower energy costs). The shell and the common areas are sustainably maintained, which includes cleaning the stairwell, maintenance of installations and window cleaning.

 LOCATION 
 Recht Boomssloot is a charming and somewhat lesser-known and quiet canal in the heart of Amsterdam, located in the central district. The street runs parallel to the famous canals and offers a picturesque and peaceful setting, while still providing easy access to the city's vibrant culture. This street is part of the historic center of Amsterdam, where you will find a mix of traditional and modern architecture, picturesque canals and proximity to some of the city's most important sights, such as the Noorderkerk, the Jordaan and the lively Nieuwmarktplein. Despite its central location, the street is relatively quiet, making it an ideal place for those looking for a peaceful living environment, yet close to everything the city has to offer.

Ideally situated in relation to the city and the beach!  
 Layout: 
Street level entrance. Entrance through the hall/sun room, where your eyes catch the glass roof. To the rear, the living room flows into the dining and cooking area.

You will also find a beautiful, open space which can serve as a walk-in closet, office or sitting room. Here too, light plays the leading role, because here you can enjoy the sun, or if you prefer, you can sleep here with a view of the stars! Via the stairs the roof terrace is reachable.
