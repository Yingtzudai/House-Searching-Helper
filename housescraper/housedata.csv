                                                         Luxurious and spacious semi-detached house at Karl Millockerhof 19 in the popular Terwijde-West district of Utrecht, available from February 14 for € 3,950 per month excluding. 
 This modern house of 185m², built in 2004, has been furnished with great care and attention and offers all the comfort you need for a luxurious and practical life. The house has five spacious bedrooms, a large living room, a modern open kitchen, a small backyard facing north and a large front garden and a balcony facing south. In addition, the house is equipped with smart technologies that make daily life easier and more efficient. 
 What makes this house extra special is the extensive ""smart home"" functionality. Almost all aspects of the house can be controlled remotely with a mobile app. Think of a smart front door lock from Nuki, with which you can open the door remotely, and Tado thermostats for the radiators and convector pits in the living room, so that you can easily regulate the temperature per room. This system is not only energy efficient, but also offers the possibility to set automatic clock times for the heating per room. The automatic garage door and roller shutter on the second floor are connected to Somfy Tahoma, and the air conditioning in the office and bedroom on the top floor works via the Daikin ONECTA app. Philips Hue has been chosen for lighting in almost all rooms, so you can adjust the atmosphere in the house at the touch of a button. In the bathroom, toilet and hallway on each floor, the lights switch on and off automatically, which is both practical and energy efficient. Safety is also central: Google Nest Protect smoke and CO2 detectors have been installed in the living room, hallway and on the first and second floors, for extra peace of mind. Google Nest cameras have been placed in the front garden, back garden and in the hallway (active when the residents are not at home), and the smart video doorbell ensures that you can always see who is at the door. In addition, there is a Google security system that works with smart tags to easily switch the alarm on and off. Motion sensors in the living room and hallway on all three floors provide an extra layer of security. 
 Upon entering through the covered entrance, the light and space are immediately noticeable. The hall, with vide, toilet and staircase, provides access to the spacious living room. The living room covers the entire length of the house and has a beautiful wooden parquet floor. Large glass facades at the front and back of the house provide an abundance of natural light and provide access to the sunny front garden facing south. The garden is well maintained, with a terrace, grass and borders, ideal for summer days and relaxing evenings. 
 At the rear of the living room is the open Siematic kitchen, which is equipped with a cooking island and high-quality Siemens built-in appliances. This modern kitchen offers everything you need for a practical and stylish cooking experience. In addition, the patio door to the garden ensures that you can easily move from inside to outside, which significantly increases the living space. 
 On the first floor you will find three spacious bedrooms, all of which have wooden parquet floors. The bedroom at the front offers a beautiful view of the green strip and has a corner window frame. The bathroom on this floor is fully equipped with a bath, walk-in shower, double sink and a second toilet. 
 On the second floor there are two more bedrooms, the largest of which extends across the entire width of the house. This room could possibly be 
divided into two separate bedrooms, which would increase the number of bedrooms to six. The second floor also has a practical laundry room and access to a south-facing roof terrace, where you can enjoy the sun to the fullest.

The three rooms offer flexibility for sleep or play, and a full bathroom with a shower and bath, a separate toilet with bidet and a concrete floor with underfloor heating ensure comfort and fun. The 39 m² master floor exudes a spa-like atmosphere with a freestanding bath and separate glass shower cubicle. 
 The spacious built-in storage space, the bed in the bay window with a view of the water and the TV on the ceiling with an automated swivel arm enhance the luxury of this floor. The sun-drenched 19 m² roof terrace, ready for a jacuzzi, offers an ideal setting for relaxing under the sun amid tranquil surroundings. Above the garage is an independent studio of 28 m², equipped with heating and water connection. This space is ideal as a sleeping area for teenagers or in-laws, or as a home office with a view of the garden.

 Description provided by lessor and conditions: 
 We have a spacious family home with a lovely large backyard facing northeast. In the garden, you'll find our shed and bike shelter, our chicken coop, two seating areas (one of which is covered), and play equipment for our son. The house consists of a small hallway leading to the spacious kitchen, laundry room, and large living room. The kitchen is fully equipped and offers ample storage space. All our appliances and dinnerware will remain in the house during our trip. 
 The laundry room has extra storage, an additional sink, and is also where the central heating unit is located. The living room features a play area (toys can remain in consultation), a large cabinet with games and books (which will also stay), a dining table for eight people, and a cozy sitting area by the stove. From the living room, you can access the hallway, which leads to the toilet and a sliding door to our master bedroom. The master bedroom has a bed for three people and four wardrobes (which will, of course, be emptied). The wall-mounted cupboards contain bedding, which we will leave behind. 
 On the first floor, you'll find a study with two fully equipped workstations, a bedroom with a double bed and enough closet space for two people, and a children's room with a semi-loft bed (with a play cave/hut underneath). Additionally, there is a bathroom with a toilet, a sink with cabinet, a bathtub (with a hand shower), and a separate walk-in shower. We use the attic for storage, so it is excluded from the rental agreement. 
 Both the living room and the first floor have air conditioning units that can heat and cool. The bathroom and laundry room are equipped with infrared heating panels. The house is well insulated, with cavity wall insulation and underfloor insulation, and there are 14 solar panels on the roof. 
 In the vicinity of our house, you'll find several bus stops that can take you to the Efteling or the central station of Den Bosch. The swimming pool, sports clubs, nature areas, hospital, and major roads (A59) are within walking or biking distance. The village of Vlijmen offers all conveniences: supermarkets, restaurants, and places for takeout/delivery. There are several ATMs in the village and a variety of shops for daily and less common needs. The Helftheuvelpassage shopping center in Den Bosch West is also within biking distance. 
 In short: a fantastic place to live (temporarily). 
 Rental price 
 The rental price is excluding gas/water/electricity, but including service costs. 
 Deposit 
 At the start of the rental agreement, a deposit is required. 
 The apartment will be rented through 'Overbruggingsverhuur'. Overbruggingsverhuur provides a temporary rental agreement for properties. There is no waiting list and we offer well-kept houses for an affordable rent.

 NEIGHBORHOOD – BENOORDENHOUT 
Theo Mann-Bouwmeesterlaan 112 is located in the Benoordenhout district, one of the most beautiful and sought-after neighborhoods in The Hague. Benoordenhout is known for its peaceful and green character, with beautiful wide avenues and stylish residences. The neighborhood offers a perfect balance between luxury and livability; you can enjoy peace and space, while the vibrant city center is just a stone's throw away. 
For your daily groceries and artisanal products, you can visit various specialty shops and large supermarket chains nearby. Want to escape the hustle and bustle? The beautiful Clingendael Estate is close by. This expansive park offers plenty of opportunities for a relaxing walk, and the famous Japanese Garden – open only a few weeks a year – is a real attraction. Clingendael is accessible year-round and is a perfect place to enjoy nature.

In front of the door is the Miep Gies park, a small park where you can enjoy the sun and where the children can play. Various parks are also just around the corner, such as the Beatrixpark, the Amstelpark and the Martin Luther Kingpark. In the vicinity you will find many good primary schools, various day-care centres, sports clubs and playgrounds. 
 ACCESSIBILITY & PARKING 
The flat has an excellent location. By car, you can reach Schiphol airport within 15 minutes and the A2 and A10 motorways within 5 minutes. The property is also easy to reach by public transport. Amstel Station, RAI Station and Zuid Station are nearby. Parking is no problem. There is always plenty of parking space in front of the door/ in the street. You can apply for a permit via the permit system (permit area Zuid 4.2). 
 OPTIONS 
 
 You can occupy the flat on the second floor yourself and rent out the other independent flat through a hospita contract. Since it is 1 flat right, you will not have any problems with the new housing rating system; 
 You can rent out both properties for around €4,000 a month; 
 You can occupy both yourself. You could turn them into a nice office or use them for guests, older children or an au pair, for example. On the second floor, you could break through the wall between the kitchen and the living room and create an open kitchen here. For this, you would first need permission from the owners' association, an environmental permit from the municipality and, of course, a steel beam to support the weight.

 Location: 
Comfortable living in a building with history, is that possible? Yes, certainly, and in the heart of Alkmaar too. In a monumental neo-renaissance building from 1889 designed by the Alkmaar architect F. Vetser (1829-1903), 12 luxuriously finished apartments have been realized on Verdronkenoord 28 (former bank office). The monumental building is beautifully situated along the Alkmaar canal in the historic Alkmaar city centre with the shopping/catering area within walking distance. In the immediate vicinity are the Accijnstoren, Eenhoornbrug and the famous Sint Laurentiuskerk. 
 Heart of Alkmaar 
At the end of the Verdronkenoord you are in the 'heart of Alkmaar'. The Platte Stenen brug, the Waagplein and D'Oude stad, with numerous cafés and restaurants and in the summer the world-famous cheese market. The extensive shopping area around Laat and Langestraat is also nearby. 
 An ideal residential location for anyone who loves the living comfort of today and the atmosphere and appearance of the past.",Binnenstad-Oost,Flat,B,For rent: Flat Verdronkenoord 28,https://www.pararius.com/apartment-for-rent/alkmaar/1f661da5/verdronkenoord,Upholstered,40.0,,,1,1,2,09-01-2025,,935.0,Ground floor,,,,For rent,1901

 LAYOUT 
 You enter through the hall. All rooms can be reached from the hall. 
The apartment has a spacious and bright living room with open kitchen. 
 The living room is spacious and gives access to the balcony. The open kitchen is equipped with the necessary equipment. For example, we find a built-in fridge with freezer, a dishwasher and a combi oven. Cooking is possible on the induction plate. 
 The bedrooms are roughly the same size and spacious enough for a double bed. One bedroom, on the other hand, offers direct access to the balcony with open views. The bathroom has a walk-in shower and modern sink with furniture. 
 The toilet is separate and located in the hallway. 
 There is a separate storage room in the apartment where the washing machine connection can be found. 
 There is a Bring-Me-Box system in the central hall for the delivery and collection of parcels. 
 The house is equipped with underfloor heating and cooling. This means that you will experience a pleasant temperature in the home throughout the year. The mechanical air ventilation system is automatically controlled, but it can also be operated manually. 
 SURROUNDINGS 
  
The complex has a communal landscaped courtyard where you can find a sunny spot at any time of the day. This courtyard is only accessible to residents. Drinks are organized throughout the year to catch up with the neighbors. 
The apartment is located on Zeeburgereiland. Various restaurants, cafes and a supermarket can be found around the corner. 
Zeeburgereiland is the ideal place to enjoy the surroundings, the water and the space, directly adjacent to the city center. Due to its location within the Ring A10, you can reach the Javastraat, the beautiful Flevopark and the Dappermarkt in East within 10 minutes by bike. Tram 26 takes you to Central Station within 10 minutes. 
Just around the corner is the largest skate park in the Netherlands, which is part of the Urban Sport Zone, a public sports park. For such matters you can go to the nearby IJburg.

 Historical background: 
built in 1923, the hillehof was once the largest school complex in rotterdam (6000m2).

Originally, the building housed three schools and featured classrooms, a gymnasium, a bathhouse, two staff houses, and a covered children's playground. 
 Vreewijk is known for its unique urban and architectural design, being a historic garden city district. It was one of the first garden city developments in the netherlands, designed in the early 20th century. Zuidplein shopping center, with its numerous shops, is around the corner, and the metro stopping at this shopping center takes you to rotterdam central station and the city center in 10 minutes. Close to various highways (a15 + a16) and multiple bus stops (within walking distance). 
 layout: 
The entrance to the loft can be made from the courtyard adjacent to vorkstraat, where you can enter the living room, or through a small courtyard adjacent to ploegstraat, allowing you to enter the apartment through the kitchen. This apartment has large window areas on all sides. On the ground floor, you'll find the living room and kitchen.

This offers residents optimal living pleasure and convenience at the lowest possible ecological footprint. It is great to see that everyone uses those shared extra spaces exactly as they are intended. That goes very organically. As TO BE AT, we are there for the residents, to bring soul to this fantastic building. With hospitality, services and technology. Facility manager Marco is there every day to answer questions and pick up jobs. And community manager Rajeb himself lives in the building.

In WesterparkWest, you live with all the comforts and facilities of the city, in the greenery of an urban square with everything you need. A good cup of coffee on the terrace, running routes through the park, in the middle of urban life with all the space and comfort. 
The old office area serves as the raw material for a new, modern residential area. From closed to open. From grey and gloomy to green and relaxed. From workplace to a relaxed residential, working and living environment. 
 One prime location, seven residential buildings 
WesterparkWest offers a wide range of high-quality rental housing spread across seven unique residential buildings: Salt, Pepper, Blend and the four Basil buildings (North, East, South and West). Together, these buildings offer 552 flats, each with its own character and appeal. Whether you are young, old, single or living together, here you will find a home that suits you. The homes range from 1-, 2-, 3- and even 4-room flats and are designed with the modern resident in mind. 
A significant proportion of the flats in Basil (95 of the 250 homes) are available for middle-income earners, according to the guidelines of the Amsterdam municipality. These homes are subject to a maximum income limit of €75,362 (price level 2024). In addition, a number of free sector flats offer the option of being shared by two house-sharing tenants. 
 Sustainable and comfortable living 
All buildings in WesterparkWest combine comfort with sustainability. The flats are connected to a WKO system, which provides regulated heating in winter and cooling in summer. They have excellent ventilation and have at least energy label A, with some homes even achieving A++ or A+++. Solar panels on the roofs provide energy for general facilities, making the buildings contribute to a more sustainable future. NOTE: Tenants enter into a separate, separate agreement with Unica for the WKO system. The agreement, rates and conditions will be shared when the rental agreement is sent. 
 Unique living comfort 
Each flat offers fantastic views and a carefree living experience. Smart layouts, modern amenities and a peaceful living environment make WesterparkWest a place where everyone feels at home in the heart of Amsterdam. You can easily store your bicycle under the complex. If you have an electric bike, you can easily charge the loose battery in a locker. For car enthusiasts, a private parking space is additionally available for rent. The monthly rent is € 175 (plus € 15 service charge per month). 
 In the green 
Westerpark is literally at your feet. Westerpark West is built and designed as a very high-quality place to live, work and recreate. Picnicking with your friends, playing football with the children, running laps with your neighbours or quietly enjoying the view from your own terrace: it's all possible here. We try to make ‘time’ here into Quality Time in every way possible. We do this with good facilities for the entire neighbourhood (think catering establishments, day nurseries) and smart, comfortable buildings (use of sustainable installations and state-of-the-art technology). In addition, we examine whether and how we can provide a possible programme of shared and personal services, such as cleaning and concierge services. 
 Location 
Everything within walking distance and by bike you will experience a wide variety of city activities within 15 minutes. Fine dining, cinema, theatre, strolling, concerts Amsterdam offers so much and from WesterParkWest everything is within easy reach. If you do want to get out of the city, the motorway, train or metro are within easy reach. 
 Income standard 
For this project, the (joint) gross monthly income must be at least equal to 3.5 times the basic monthly rent. We do not take equity and guarantees into account. Entrepreneurs must have been active for at least 2 years.

 About the livingspace 
A three-room apartment on location ""Oostenburg"" in Amsterdam 
 About this type of property 
This property is the option for families looking for a spacious home near the city. From the hall you reach the large living and dining area, well-lit and spacious thanks to the open-plan kitchen. From the living room you have access to a balcony. Large enough for a nice sitting area, so that you can enjoy the view over the city with a drink. Space prevails in the whole flat, because the two bedrooms even have their own hall. These bedrooms have large French windows and are almost the same size. This allows each member of the family to have his or her own space. But even without children, the second bedroom comes in handy - use it, for example, as a large work or study space.

 About the livingspace 
An apartment on location ""Overtoomse Veld Zuid"" in Amsterdam 
 About the project 
LOCATION 
The building is located in the Nieuw-West district, just outside the Amsterdam ring road. Supermarkets and nice cosy shops and restaurants are in the immediate vicinity. In addition, there is plenty of greenery within walking distance; on one side of the building the Sloterplas with surrounding park and on the other side the Rembrandtpark with its beautiful ponds, lawns and playgrounds and which also offers a 'green' cycling route to the city centre. The centre of Amsterdam is only 15 minutes away by bike from the apartment. At a short distance from the building are several bus, tram and metro stops via which you can be door-to-door at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport in half an hour, as well as Amsterdam Central Station. By car, you can reach the A10 motorway within minutes. 
 OUR SERVICES 
The Tenant Ambassadors from To Be At are at your service every day to provide you with an optimal living experience. Whether it's carrying out a repair request in your home, directing the cleaning when an accident has happened or just having a chat, they are happy to do so. You speak to them in the atrium, create a ticket in our own resident app or send a chat message - getting in touch has never been easier! 
With our services, we make your life easier and more fun! For example, we offer various services such as the Miele Laundry Boutique, a shared laundry facility, MyPup lockers, for receiving and sending packages in a safe and sustainable way, and you can book our cleaning service for cleaning your studio. 
Already interested in renting an apartment? Check if you are eligible and sign up to rent! 
 OUR COMMUNITY 
We're on a mission to reintroduce the element of community in urban apartment living. The ecosystem we create, helps you interact with your fellow residents while protecting your personal space. From cozy get-to-gethers to big events with your neighbors; we believe that life is infinitely more joyful when we're truly connected and never need to feel alone. 
The building has an atrium where you can work and enjoy a snack from the vending machines. Next to the atrium is the communal living room, which invites you to relax, watch a movie or play a game with your fellow residents. 
Both areas are designed to encourage interaction so you can connect with your neighbours. Both spaces are currently undergoing an 'upgrade'. They are being completely repainted and fitted with new furniture, so that these spaces can be even better used by the community and you too can really feel at home there. 
 WHAT WILL THE RENT OF AN APARTMENT COST ME? 
The basic rent is EUR 805 per month. 
In addition, you pay a service charge of EUR 176 (including EUR 45 for heating) per month. These costs are charged for the services offered, such as the caretakers (Tenant Ambassadors), cleaning, security, flooring, sunblind but also for internet and heating in your apartment. 
Service costs are an advance payment. Every year, you will receive an overview of the actual costs incurred. If applicable, the costs will be settled. 
You enter into a rent contract for one year. After that, the contract can be terminated monthly. 
There is a possibility to apply for rent allowance. Whether you are eligible for a rent allowance is of course entirely dependent on your income, you can calculate this on the website of the Dutch tax authorities. 
 AM I ELIGIBLE TO RENT AN APARTMENT? 
You are eligible to rent an apartment if you meet all these conditions: 
 
 
 I am a young professional (age 18-36 years old) 
 
 
 I am looking for a living environment with a community of like-minded people 
 
 
 I earn a gross salary of EUR 3.220 per month 
 
 
 I want to rent for at least one year 
 
 
 In this project, guaranteeing eligibility is not possible!  
 
 
 PLEASE NOTE: because the basic rent is social rent, a housing permit is necessary for every tenant. Your annual income must therefore not be too high, among other things (limit: gross annual income €57,926 for 2025). Avoid disappointment afterwards, so read more information on the Amsterdam website!

 About the livingspace 
An apartment on location ""Overtoomse Veld Zuid"" in Amsterdam 
 About the project 
LOCATION 
The building is located in the Nieuw-West district, just outside the Amsterdam ring road. Supermarkets and nice cosy shops and restaurants are in the immediate vicinity. In addition, there is plenty of greenery within walking distance; on one side of the building the Sloterplas with surrounding park and on the other side the Rembrandtpark with its beautiful ponds, lawns and playgrounds and which also offers a 'green' cycling route to the city centre. The centre of Amsterdam is only 15 minutes away by bike from the apartment. At a short distance from the building are several bus, tram and metro stops via which you can be door-to-door at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport in half an hour, as well as Amsterdam Central Station. By car, you can reach the A10 motorway within minutes. 
 OUR SERVICES 
The Tenant Ambassadors from To Be At are at your service every day to provide you with an optimal living experience. Whether it's carrying out a repair request in your home, directing the cleaning when an accident has happened or just having a chat, they are happy to do so. You speak to them in the atrium, create a ticket in our own resident app or send a chat message - getting in touch has never been easier! 
With our services, we make your life easier and more fun! For example, we offer various services such as the Miele Laundry Boutique, a shared laundry facility, MyPup lockers, for receiving and sending packages in a safe and sustainable way, and you can book our cleaning service for cleaning your studio. 
Already interested in renting an apartment? Check if you are eligible and sign up to rent! 
 OUR COMMUNITY 
We're on a mission to reintroduce the element of community in urban apartment living. The ecosystem we create, helps you interact with your fellow residents while protecting your personal space. From cozy get-to-gethers to big events with your neighbors; we believe that life is infinitely more joyful when we're truly connected and never need to feel alone. 
The building has an atrium where you can work and enjoy a snack from the vending machines. Next to the atrium is the communal living room, which invites you to relax, watch a movie or play a game with your fellow residents. 
Both areas are designed to encourage interaction so you can connect with your neighbours. Both spaces are currently undergoing an 'upgrade'. They are being completely repainted and fitted with new furniture, so that these spaces can be even better used by the community and you too can really feel at home there. 
 WHAT WILL THE RENT OF AN APARTMENT COST ME? 
The basic rent is EUR 805 per month. 
In addition, you pay a service charge of EUR 176 (including EUR 45 for heating) per month. These costs are charged for the services offered, such as the caretakers (Tenant Ambassadors), cleaning, security, flooring, sunblind but also for internet and heating in your apartment. 
Service costs are an advance payment. Every year, you will receive an overview of the actual costs incurred. If applicable, the costs will be settled. 
You enter into a rent contract for one year. After that, the contract can be terminated monthly. 
There is a possibility to apply for rent allowance. Whether you are eligible for a rent allowance is of course entirely dependent on your income, you can calculate this on the website of the Dutch tax authorities. 
 AM I ELIGIBLE TO RENT AN APARTMENT? 
You are eligible to rent an apartment if you meet all these conditions: 
 
 
 I am a young professional (age 18-36 years old) 
 
 
 I am looking for a living environment with a community of like-minded people 
 
 
 I earn a gross salary of EUR 3.220 per month 
 
 
 I want to rent for at least one year 
 
 
 In this project, guaranteeing eligibility is not possible!  
 
 
 PLEASE NOTE: because the basic rent is social rent, a housing permit is necessary for every tenant. Your annual income must therefore not be too high, among other things (limit: gross annual income €57,926 for 2025). Avoid disappointment afterwards, so read more information on the Amsterdam website!

 The Tolkazerne in Bastion 6 was built as a Tolhuys in 1598. This was to replace a previous “Tolhuys”, which burned down in 1584. 
 The building was used to collect tolls from ships sailing past Gorinchem. Later, the Tolhuys was used as a barracks. 
 In 1425, the Counts of Holland established a toll in Gorinchem. For this purpose, a toll house was built on the west side of the city, where the Linge river flows into the Merwede. The building was part of the castle grounds of the Counts of Holland. 
 After two fires at the end of the 16th century, the building was modernised. Until 1795 it was used as a toll house, after which it was inhabited by a French general and after the French left it was taken into use as a barracks by the Ministry of War in 1814. In the 19th and 20th centuries the building had a varied use; military cholera hospital, civilian school for boys, main building of the position commander of the New Dutch Waterline, a public reading room, tax office and a police station. In 1977 it was transferred to the Vereniging Hendrick de Keyser Monumenten. 
 The building has a picturesque appearance due to the difference in building height, roof shapes and irregular floor plan and is a defining feature of the city silhouette both from the water and from the city. The main part of the complex is located on the Molenstraat. A large cross wing with an octagonal staircase tower was built on this. Both parts of the building were completed in 1598.

 About the project 
Renting a studio in Amsterdam Zuidoost? 
At 801 Elizabeth Cady Stantonplein, you will find this beautiful Young Professional building, completed in 2019. The building is 10 floors high and has around 500 studios specially designed for working young people aged between 18 and 36. The building is sustainable, green and natural gas-free. In this way, the landlord contributes to a green planet. 
 The location 
Amsterdam-Zuidoost is close to various parks such as the Nelson Mandela Park (a 5-minute walk). There is also a nice shopping centre at 1-minute walking distance: Amsterdamse Poort. Amsterdam-Zuidoost is easily accessible by public transport. Both train station and metro station Amsterdam Bijlmer Arena are only a 10-minute walk away. There are also many bus connections, making it easy to reach small nearby towns as well. 
 Our service 
You enter the building with a badge system. At the entrance, you can choose to take the lift to your studio or take the stairs to the atrium. In the spacious atrium, you can meet other residents or find a quiet place to work. Next to the atrium is the communal living room, here too you can meet fellow residents or find some relaxation! 
 DO I QUALIFY TO RENT A FLAT? 
You are eligible to rent a flat if you meet all these conditions: 
 
 I am a young professional (18-36 years old). 
 I am looking for a living environment with a community of like-minded people. 
 I earn a gross monthly salary of at least 3.5 times the basic rent. 
 I want to rent for at least one year. 
 In this project, guaranteeing eligibility is not possible!. 
 
 PLEASE NOTE: because the basic rent is social rent, a housing permit is necessary for every tenant. Your annual income must therefore not be too high, among other things (limit: gross annual income €57,926 for 2025.) Avoid disappointment afterwards, so read more information on the Amsterdam website!

 About the project 
WesterparkWest 
In WesterparkWest, you live with all the comforts and facilities of the city, in the greenery of an urban square with everything you need. A good cup of coffee on the terrace, running routes through the park, in the middle of urban life with all the space and comfort. 
The old office area serves as the raw material for a new, modern residential area. From closed to open. From grey and gloomy to green and relaxed. From workplace to a relaxed residential, working and living environment. 
 One prime location, seven residential buildings 
WesterparkWest offers a wide range of high-quality rental housing spread across seven unique residential buildings: Salt, Pepper, Blend and the four Basil buildings (North, East, South and West). Together, these buildings offer 552 flats, each with its own character and appeal. Whether you are young, old, single or living together, here you will find a home that suits you. The homes range from 1-, 2-, 3- and even 4-room flats and are designed with the modern resident in mind. 
A significant proportion of the flats in Basil (95 of the 250 homes) are available for middle-income earners, according to the guidelines of the Amsterdam municipality. These homes are subject to a maximum income limit of €75,362 (price level 2024). In addition, a number of free sector flats offer the option of being shared by two house-sharing tenants. 
 Sustainable and comfortable living 
All buildings in WesterparkWest combine comfort with sustainability. The flats are connected to a WKO system, which provides regulated heating in winter and cooling in summer. They have excellent ventilation and have at least energy label A, with some homes even achieving A++ or A+++. Solar panels on the roofs provide energy for general facilities, making the buildings contribute to a more sustainable future. NOTE: Tenants enter into a separate, separate agreement with Unica for the WKO system. The agreement, rates and conditions will be shared when the rental agreement is sent. 
 Unique living comfort 
Each flat offers fantastic views and a carefree living experience. Smart layouts, modern amenities and a peaceful living environment make WesterparkWest a place where everyone feels at home in the heart of Amsterdam. You can easily store your bicycle under the complex. If you have an electric bike, you can easily charge the loose battery in a locker. For car enthusiasts, a private parking space is additionally available for rent. The monthly rent is € 175 (plus € 15 service charge per month). 
 In the green 
Westerpark is literally at your feet. Westerpark West is built and designed as a very high-quality place to live, work and recreate. Picnicking with your friends, playing football with the children, running laps with your neighbours or quietly enjoying the view from your own terrace: it's all possible here. We try to make ‘time’ here into Quality Time in every way possible. We do this with good facilities for the entire neighbourhood (think catering establishments, day nurseries) and smart, comfortable buildings (use of sustainable installations and state-of-the-art technology). In addition, we examine whether and how we can provide a possible programme of shared and personal services, such as cleaning and concierge services. 
 Location 
Everything within walking distance and by bike you will experience a wide variety of city activities within 15 minutes. Fine dining, cinema, theatre, strolling, concerts Amsterdam offers so much and from WesterParkWest everything is within easy reach. If you do want to get out of the city, the motorway, train or metro are within easy reach. 
 Income standard 
For this project, the (joint) gross monthly income must be at least equal to 3.5 times the basic monthly rent. We do not take equity and guarantees into account. Entrepreneurs must have been active for at least 2 years.

 About the livingspace 
An apartment on location ""Overtoomse Veld Zuid"" in Amsterdam 
 About the project 
LOCATION 
The building is located in the Nieuw-West district, just outside the Amsterdam ring road. Supermarkets and nice cosy shops and restaurants are in the immediate vicinity. In addition, there is plenty of greenery within walking distance; on one side of the building the Sloterplas with surrounding park and on the other side the Rembrandtpark with its beautiful ponds, lawns and playgrounds and which also offers a 'green' cycling route to the city centre. The centre of Amsterdam is only 15 minutes away by bike from the apartment. At a short distance from the building are several bus, tram and metro stops via which you can be door-to-door at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport in half an hour, as well as Amsterdam Central Station. By car, you can reach the A10 motorway within minutes. 
 OUR SERVICES 
The Tenant Ambassadors from To Be At are at your service every day to provide you with an optimal living experience. Whether it's carrying out a repair request in your home, directing the cleaning when an accident has happened or just having a chat, they are happy to do so. You speak to them in the atrium, create a ticket in our own resident app or send a chat message - getting in touch has never been easier! 
With our services, we make your life easier and more fun! For example, we offer various services such as the Miele Laundry Boutique, a shared laundry facility, MyPup lockers, for receiving and sending packages in a safe and sustainable way, and you can book our cleaning service for cleaning your studio. 
Already interested in renting an apartment? Check if you are eligible and sign up to rent! 
 OUR COMMUNITY 
We're on a mission to reintroduce the element of community in urban apartment living. The ecosystem we create, helps you interact with your fellow residents while protecting your personal space. From cozy get-to-gethers to big events with your neighbors; we believe that life is infinitely more joyful when we're truly connected and never need to feel alone. 
The building has an atrium where you can work and enjoy a snack from the vending machines. Next to the atrium is the communal living room, which invites you to relax, watch a movie or play a game with your fellow residents. 
Both areas are designed to encourage interaction so you can connect with your neighbours. Both spaces are currently undergoing an 'upgrade'. They are being completely repainted and fitted with new furniture, so that these spaces can be even better used by the community and you too can really feel at home there. 
 WHAT WILL THE RENT OF AN APARTMENT COST ME? 
The basic rent is EUR 805 per month. 
In addition, you pay a service charge of EUR 176 (including EUR 45 for heating) per month. These costs are charged for the services offered, such as the caretakers (Tenant Ambassadors), cleaning, security, flooring, sunblind but also for internet and heating in your apartment. 
Service costs are an advance payment. Every year, you will receive an overview of the actual costs incurred. If applicable, the costs will be settled. 
You enter into a rent contract for one year. After that, the contract can be terminated monthly. 
There is a possibility to apply for rent allowance. Whether you are eligible for a rent allowance is of course entirely dependent on your income, you can calculate this on the website of the Dutch tax authorities. 
 AM I ELIGIBLE TO RENT AN APARTMENT? 
You are eligible to rent an apartment if you meet all these conditions: 
 
 
 I am a young professional (age 18-36 years old) 
 
 
 I am looking for a living environment with a community of like-minded people 
 
 
 I earn a gross salary of EUR 3.220 per month 
 
 
 I want to rent for at least one year 
 
 
 In this project, guaranteeing eligibility is not possible!  
 
 
 PLEASE NOTE: because the basic rent is social rent, a housing permit is necessary for every tenant. Your annual income must therefore not be too high, among other things (limit: gross annual income €57,926 for 2025). Avoid disappointment afterwards, so read more information on the Amsterdam website!

 About the project 
WesterparkWest 
In WesterparkWest, you live with all the comforts and facilities of the city, in the greenery of an urban square with everything you need. A good cup of coffee on the terrace, running routes through the park, in the middle of urban life with all the space and comfort. 
The old office area serves as the raw material for a new, modern residential area. From closed to open. From grey and gloomy to green and relaxed. From workplace to a relaxed residential, working and living environment. 
 One prime location, seven residential buildings 
WesterparkWest offers a wide range of high-quality rental housing spread across seven unique residential buildings: Salt, Pepper, Blend and the four Basil buildings (North, East, South and West). Together, these buildings offer 552 flats, each with its own character and appeal. Whether you are young, old, single or living together, here you will find a home that suits you. The homes range from 1-, 2-, 3- and even 4-room flats and are designed with the modern resident in mind. 
A significant proportion of the flats in Basil (95 of the 250 homes) are available for middle-income earners, according to the guidelines of the Amsterdam municipality. These homes are subject to a maximum income limit of €75,362 (price level 2024). In addition, a number of free sector flats offer the option of being shared by two house-sharing tenants. 
 Sustainable and comfortable living 
All buildings in WesterparkWest combine comfort with sustainability. The flats are connected to a WKO system, which provides regulated heating in winter and cooling in summer. They have excellent ventilation and have at least energy label A, with some homes even achieving A++ or A+++. Solar panels on the roofs provide energy for general facilities, making the buildings contribute to a more sustainable future. NOTE: Tenants enter into a separate, separate agreement with Unica for the WKO system. The agreement, rates and conditions will be shared when the rental agreement is sent.

Renting a studio in Amsterdam Zuidoost? 
At 801 Elizabeth Cady Stantonplein, you will find this beautiful Young Professional building, completed in 2019. The building is 10 floors high and has around 500 studios specially designed for working young people aged between 18 and 36. The building is sustainable, green and natural gas-free. In this way, the landlord contributes to a green planet. 
 The location 
Amsterdam-Zuidoost is close to various parks such as the Nelson Mandela Park (a 5-minute walk). There is also a nice shopping centre at 1-minute walking distance: Amsterdamse Poort. Amsterdam-Zuidoost is easily accessible by public transport. Both train station and metro station Amsterdam Bijlmer Arena are only a 10-minute walk away. There are also many bus connections, making it easy to reach small nearby towns as well. 
 Our service 
You enter the building with a badge system. At the entrance, you can choose to take the lift to your studio or take the stairs to the atrium. In the spacious atrium, you can meet other residents or find a quiet place to work. Next to the atrium is the communal living room, here too you can meet fellow residents or find some relaxation!

You are eligible to rent a flat if you meet all these conditions: 
 
 I am a young professional (18-36 years old). 
 I am looking for a living environment with a community of like-minded people. 
 I earn a gross monthly salary of at least 3.5 times the basic rent. 
 I want to rent for at least one year.

 About the project 
WesterparkWest 
In WesterparkWest, you live with all the comforts and facilities of the city, in the greenery of an urban square with everything you need. A good cup of coffee on the terrace, running routes through the park, in the middle of urban life with all the space and comfort. 
The old office area serves as the raw material for a new, modern residential area. From closed to open. From grey and gloomy to green and relaxed. From workplace to a relaxed residential, working and living environment. 
 One prime location, seven residential buildings 
WesterparkWest offers a wide range of high-quality rental housing spread across seven unique residential buildings: Salt, Pepper, Blend and the four Basil buildings (North, East, South and West). Together, these buildings offer 552 flats, each with its own character and appeal. Whether you are young, old, single or living together, here you will find a home that suits you. The homes range from 1-, 2-, 3- and even 4-room flats and are designed with the modern resident in mind. 
A significant proportion of the flats in Basil (95 of the 250 homes) are available for middle-income earners, according to the guidelines of the Amsterdam municipality. These homes are subject to a maximum income limit of €75,362 (price level 2024). In addition, a number of free sector flats offer the option of being shared by two house-sharing tenants. 
 Sustainable and comfortable living 
All buildings in WesterparkWest combine comfort with sustainability. The flats are connected to a WKO system, which provides regulated heating in winter and cooling in summer. They have excellent ventilation and have at least energy label A, with some homes even achieving A++ or A+++. Solar panels on the roofs provide energy for general facilities, making the buildings contribute to a more sustainable future. NOTE: Tenants enter into a separate, separate agreement with Unica for the WKO system. The agreement, rates and conditions will be shared when the rental agreement is sent. 
 Unique living comfort 
Each flat offers fantastic views and a carefree living experience. Smart layouts, modern amenities and a peaceful living environment make WesterparkWest a place where everyone feels at home in the heart of Amsterdam. You can easily store your bicycle under the complex. If you have an electric bike, you can easily charge the loose battery in a locker. For car enthusiasts, a private parking space is additionally available for rent. The monthly rent is € 175 (plus € 15 service charge per month). 
 In the green 
Westerpark is literally at your feet. Westerpark West is built and designed as a very high-quality place to live, work and recreate. Picnicking with your friends, playing football with the children, running laps with your neighbours or quietly enjoying the view from your own terrace: it's all possible here. We try to make ‘time’ here into Quality Time in every way possible. We do this with good facilities for the entire neighbourhood (think catering establishments, day nurseries) and smart, comfortable buildings (use of sustainable installations and state-of-the-art technology). In addition, we examine whether and how we can provide a possible programme of shared and personal services, such as cleaning and concierge services. 
 Location 
Everything within walking distance and by bike you will experience a wide variety of city activities within 15 minutes. Fine dining, cinema, theatre, strolling, concerts Amsterdam offers so much and from WesterParkWest everything is within easy reach. If you do want to get out of the city, the motorway, train or metro are within easy reach. 
 Income standard 
For this project, the (joint) gross monthly income must be at least equal to 3.5 times the basic monthly rent. We do not take equity and guarantees into account. Entrepreneurs must have been active for at least 2 years.

 About the project 
Welcome to Domūs Houthaven 
Views of the city centre on one side and Amsterdam's harbours on the other. Domūs Houthaven is located in the middle of the new sustainable city district, right next to the centre of Amsterdam. With 235 rental flats and various communal areas and services, everything here is geared towards modern city living. Properties are regularly available. 
 A smart home 
Domūs Houthaven features a diversity of flats. Ranging from 40 sqm to 60 sqm. All homes come with solid PVC flooring, curtains and the ‘smart living core’ with kitchen, bathroom, cupboards, and bed. So ready to move into.

Living at Domūs is living with many extra amenities. In the living room and roof garden, you walk in to work for a while or meet others. The other facilities work on a ‘pay per use’ basis. So no unnecessarily high service costs, but only pay for what you actually use. 
 Bringing soul into the building 
Shared spaces and facilities play a key role in Domūs Living. Christa de Buvry de Mauregnault, owner of operator TO BE AT, makes sure everything is arranged and runs smoothly at the venue. ‘The uniqueness of Domūs lies in the combination of a smart, compact home with the possibility of extra living space in the shared living room, cooking studio and garden. This offers residents optimal living pleasure and convenience at the lowest possible ecological footprint. It is great to see that everyone uses those shared extra spaces exactly as they are intended. That goes very organically. As TO BE AT, we are there for the residents, to bring soul to this fantastic building. With hospitality, services and technology. Facility manager Marco is there every day to answer questions and pick up jobs. And community manager Rajeb himself lives in the building. He will help and inspire fellow residents to organise activities. Tenant satisfaction is already high: Domūs scores a 9.3. We are proud of that and want to maintain it!’

 About the project 
LOCATION 
The building is located in the Nieuw-West district, just outside the Amsterdam ring road. Supermarkets and nice cosy shops and restaurants are in the immediate vicinity. In addition, there is plenty of greenery within walking distance; on one side of the building the Sloterplas with surrounding park and on the other side the Rembrandtpark with its beautiful ponds, lawns and playgrounds and which also offers a 'green' cycling route to the city centre. The centre of Amsterdam is only 15 minutes away by bike from the apartment. At a short distance from the building are several bus, tram and metro stops via which you can be door-to-door at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport in half an hour, as well as Amsterdam Central Station. By car, you can reach the A10 motorway within minutes. 
 OUR SERVICES 
The Tenant Ambassadors from To Be At are at your service every day to provide you with an optimal living experience. Whether it's carrying out a repair request in your home, directing the cleaning when an accident has happened or just having a chat, they are happy to do so. You speak to them in the atrium, create a ticket in our own resident app or send a chat message - getting in touch has never been easier! 
With our services, we make your life easier and more fun! For example, we offer various services such as the Miele Laundry Boutique, a shared laundry facility, MyPup lockers, for receiving and sending packages in a safe and sustainable way, and you can book our cleaning service for cleaning your studio. 
Already interested in renting an apartment? Check if you are eligible and sign up to rent! 
 OUR COMMUNITY 
We're on a mission to reintroduce the element of community in urban apartment living. The ecosystem we create, helps you interact with your fellow residents while protecting your personal space. From cozy get-to-gethers to big events with your neighbors; we believe that life is infinitely more joyful when we're truly connected and never need to feel alone. 
The building has an atrium where you can work and enjoy a snack from the vending machines. Next to the atrium is the communal living room, which invites you to relax, watch a movie or play a game with your fellow residents. 
Both areas are designed to encourage interaction so you can connect with your neighbours. Both spaces are currently undergoing an 'upgrade'. They are being completely repainted and fitted with new furniture, so that these spaces can be even better used by the community and you too can really feel at home there. 
 WHAT WILL THE RENT OF AN APARTMENT COST ME? 
The basic rent is EUR 805 per month. 
In addition, you pay a service charge of EUR 176 (including EUR 45 for heating) per month. These costs are charged for the services offered, such as the caretakers (Tenant Ambassadors), cleaning, security, flooring, sunblind but also for internet and heating in your apartment. 
Service costs are an advance payment. Every year, you will receive an overview of the actual costs incurred. If applicable, the costs will be settled. 
You enter into a rent contract for one year. After that, the contract can be terminated monthly. 
There is a possibility to apply for rent allowance. Whether you are eligible for a rent allowance is of course entirely dependent on your income, you can calculate this on the website of the Dutch tax authorities. 
 AM I ELIGIBLE TO RENT AN APARTMENT? 
You are eligible to rent an apartment if you meet all these conditions: 
 
 
 I am a young professional (age 18-36 years old) 
 
 
 I am looking for a living environment with a community of like-minded people 
 
 
 I earn a gross salary of EUR 3.220 per month 
 
 
 I want to rent for at least one year 
 
 
 In this project, guaranteeing eligibility is not possible!  
 
 
 PLEASE NOTE: because the basic rent is social rent, a housing permit is necessary for every tenant. Your annual income must therefore not be too high, among other things (limit: gross annual income €57,926 for 2025). Avoid disappointment afterwards, so read more information on the Amsterdam website!

 About the project 
WesterparkWest 
In WesterparkWest, you live with all the comforts and facilities of the city, in the greenery of an urban square with everything you need. A good cup of coffee on the terrace, running routes through the park, in the middle of urban life with all the space and comfort. 
The old office area serves as the raw material for a new, modern residential area. From closed to open. From grey and gloomy to green and relaxed. From workplace to a relaxed residential, working and living environment. 
 One prime location, seven residential buildings 
WesterparkWest offers a wide range of high-quality rental housing spread across seven unique residential buildings: Salt, Pepper, Blend and the four Basil buildings (North, East, South and West). Together, these buildings offer 552 flats, each with its own character and appeal. Whether you are young, old, single or living together, here you will find a home that suits you. The homes range from 1-, 2-, 3- and even 4-room flats and are designed with the modern resident in mind. 
A significant proportion of the flats in Basil (95 of the 250 homes) are available for middle-income earners, according to the guidelines of the Amsterdam municipality. These homes are subject to a maximum income limit of €75,362 (price level 2024). In addition, a number of free sector flats offer the option of being shared by two house-sharing tenants. 
 Sustainable and comfortable living 
All buildings in WesterparkWest combine comfort with sustainability. The flats are connected to a WKO system, which provides regulated heating in winter and cooling in summer. They have excellent ventilation and have at least energy label A, with some homes even achieving A++ or A+++. Solar panels on the roofs provide energy for general facilities, making the buildings contribute to a more sustainable future. NOTE: Tenants enter into a separate, separate agreement with Unica for the WKO system. The agreement, rates and conditions will be shared when the rental agreement is sent. 
 Unique living comfort 
Each flat offers fantastic views and a carefree living experience. Smart layouts, modern amenities and a peaceful living environment make WesterparkWest a place where everyone feels at home in the heart of Amsterdam. You can easily store your bicycle under the complex. If you have an electric bike, you can easily charge the loose battery in a locker. For car enthusiasts, a private parking space is additionally available for rent. The monthly rent is € 175 (plus € 15 service charge per month). 
 In the green 
Westerpark is literally at your feet. Westerpark West is built and designed as a very high-quality place to live, work and recreate. Picnicking with your friends, playing football with the children, running laps with your neighbours or quietly enjoying the view from your own terrace: it's all possible here. We try to make ‘time’ here into Quality Time in every way possible. We do this with good facilities for the entire neighbourhood (think catering establishments, day nurseries) and smart, comfortable buildings (use of sustainable installations and state-of-the-art technology). In addition, we examine whether and how we can provide a possible programme of shared and personal services, such as cleaning and concierge services. 
 Location 
Everything within walking distance and by bike you will experience a wide variety of city activities within 15 minutes. Fine dining, cinema, theatre, strolling, concerts Amsterdam offers so much and from WesterParkWest everything is within easy reach. If you do want to get out of the city, the motorway, train or metro are within easy reach. 
 Income standard 
For this project, the (joint) gross monthly income must be at least equal to 3.5 times the basic monthly rent. We do not take equity and guarantees into account. Entrepreneurs must have been active for at least 2 years.

                                                         ARCHITECTURALLY DESIGNED AND FURNISHED APARTMENT AVAILABLE ON KORTE NOODGODSSTRAAT IN GOUDA 
 On Korte Noodgodsstraat in Gouda, you will find this spacious apartment of 131 m², featuring two bedrooms and an indoor outdoor space. However, it’s not the size of this city-center apartment that makes it special, nor the fact that this maisonette includes an indoor outdoor space. No, it’s the unique design of the apartment that we would like to highlight. Words cannot do justice to the quality and appeal of this home, so we warmly invite you to take a look at the photos in this advertisement. 
 Still curious about how we describe this property? Read on: 
 Through the central entrance with an intercom system and mailboxes, you enter the former post office on Korte Noodgodsstraat, located in the heart of Gouda’s city center. The front door of this property is situated on the first floor of the complex, where you will find a spacious hallway with a cloakroom, toilet, and utility meter cupboard. 
 From the hallway, you enter the spacious and open living room, from which all living areas of the home are visible. The space is equipped with large windows spanning the entire facade, allowing for ample natural light. The use of glass walls allows light to flow freely throughout the home. 
 The living room, featuring a stylish poured floor, is spacious enough to comfortably accommodate both a seating area and a dining area. The kitchen has an open design and an industrial look, thanks to the extensive use of stainless steel. It is equipped with a 90 cm-wide induction hob with a large oven, an extractor hood, a dishwasher, a luxury mixer tap, and plenty of cabinet space. 
 On the second floor, accessible via the characteristic spiral staircase in the center of the living room, you will find two spacious bedrooms, a large landing ideal for creating a workspace, and the bathroom. A nice detail is that from your shower, you have a beautiful view of the rest of the home, while still enjoying the privacy you need in a bathroom. The bathroom is completed with a double sink, a separate toilet, and a utility area with connections for a washing machine and dryer. 
 An important feature to highlight is the indoor outdoor space in the living room. In the photos, you’ll recognize this area by the lounge set. This space is fully insulated from your home, and if desired, the windows can be left open 24/7. With a favorable sun orientation, it’s even possible to place outdoor plants here and see them bloom beautifully. Thanks to its sheltered location, you can enjoy this outdoor space early in the spring and late into the autumn. The apartment’s windows face the southwest side of the building and are equipped with external sunshades.

The hall connects the spacious living room with the semi-open kitchen to all the bedrooms, the bathroom, the toilet, and the indoor storage room. 
 The spacious living room is very bright, thanks to the large windows on two sides. From your living room, you have a direct view of the nearby recreational area Goudse Hout. The living room offers more than enough space to create a generous seating and dining area. 
 The semi-open kitchen offers a view into the living room, allowing the chef to stay connected with other family members. Equipped with built-in appliances such as a dishwasher, refrigerator, oven, gas hob, extractor hood, and ample cupboard space, the kitchen is fully equipped. The utility room provides additional storage space. 
 The apartment has three spacious bedrooms, all of which are well-maintained. The master bedroom is located at the front of the building and overlooks the previously mentioned Goudse Hout. 
 The indoor bathroom features a double sink, walk-in shower, and wall-mounted toilet. Additionally, there is a separate toilet accessible from the hall. The storage room in the hall serves as a technical room and includes connections for a washing machine and dryer. This storage room is one of two storage spaces. The second storage room is located directly to the left of the front door and offers extra space as well as access to the spacious rooftop terrace. 
 This rooftop terrace is also accessible from the living room via two sets of French doors. The large rooftop terrace, estimated at 70 m², is located on the north side and offers plenty of opportunities to create a lounge area, play area, or other configurations.

 Geleen 
Geleen (Limburg: Gelaen) is a place and former municipality in the Dutch province of Limburg. It owes its name (originally ""Op-geleen"", the current Old Geleen) to its location at the Geleen River (also called the Geleenbeek), which formed the eastern border of the municipality. The place includes the former village cores Oud-Geleen, Lutterade, Krawinkel, Spaans Neerbeek and Daniken, and around them the neighbourhoods created in the last century. Anno 2018, 31,815 people live there[1]. In 2018 Geleen covers an area of 1957 hectares of land and thus has a population density of 1626 inhabitants/km². 
On 1 January 2001, Geleen was merged with Sittard and Born to form the new municipality of Sittard-Geleen.

Wilgenrijk is a green, rural and water-rich area with a high-quality vision on architecture and outdoor space that originates from the design philosophy 'the Maassluise School'.

Wilgenrijk consists of various cozy and small-scale neighborhoods, each with its own architectural characteristics, and is shielded from ambient noise by a recreational park wall. The area is also very child friendly due to the natural playgrounds, among other things.    
 Within walking distance of your house in Wilgenrijk is a unique green area, embellished by mills, canals and monumental farms with beautiful walking and cycling routes.

 Located directly on the Vecht in picturesque Maarssen, this monumental sleeping beauty has been completely transformed into a sustainable, luxurious and above all charming residential villa.

 The chapel was originally built in 1901 as a hall church for churchgoers of the Dutch Protestants. In 1965, a local architect remodeled the church. This remodel created the glass windowed alcoves, a vestibule and a floor to ceiling.

 The studio is located in a stately mansion. The mansion is completely newly built and equipped with all modern requirements. The building is fully insulated and equipped with a heat pump and solar panels, the building is also gas-free and has energy label A+! 
 The mansion combines charm and contemporary comfort into a harmonious whole. In short; this mansion is truly a picture! A total of 6 apartments/studios have been realised in this stately building. 
 A PIECE OF HISTORY 
On Kleine Marktstraat, there was a building dating back to 1840. Unfortunately, at the time of the conversion and renovation in 2021/2022, the building caught fire and was completely destroyed. We did not give up and decided to rebuild the premises. 
During the demolition of the old building, ancient remains from the 14th century were found! These can be found in the bedroom of 1 flat. Anno 2024, the new apartments/studio's have been completed. 
 LAYOUT 
Via the entrance, you enter the communal hallway and stairwell. On the 1st floor you will find the communal washing machines and dryers. 
 Open the door and you step into your studio. In total, this flat is about 36 m2 in size, with large windows, a PVC floor, new kitchen, new bathroom and fitted with underfloor heating. 
 The black kitchen with luxury countertop is elegant and modern, and above all, hyperefficiently designed. There is a dishwasher, an induction hob, an extractor hood, a combi oven/microwave and a sink. The kitchen was installed very recently! 
 Next is the small and beautiful bathroom; it too has been recently installed and is therefore also completely new. The bathroom comprises a WC with a hanging toilet, a design radiator, a washbasin and a (rain) shower. 
 ENVIRONMENT 
The right side of the property (on the outside) you walk towards the Vischmarkt, which is known for its many restaurants. Both the city centre with all its amenities and the cosy boulevard 
and the city beach are within walking distance. 
 HARDERWIJK IN A NUTSHELL 
This beautiful, monumental town has much more to offer than just a pretty face; it is a modern city in an ideal location in the country. Tranquillity and nature are just around the corner, as Harderwijk is situated on the edge of the leafy Veluwe, and on hot days the beaches along the lakes are really perfect for bathing - we speak from experience. 
The flat is also - behind the facade of classic beauty - a wonderfully comfortable and contemporary flat.
